bibo:abstract "This paper examines three ideas: First, the traditional relationship between a science, the mathematics it uses and the engineering based on it. Second, the nature of (software) computer science, which may not be a science at all, and its unusual use of mathematics. And finally, the nature of software engineering, its relationship with computer science, and its use of mathematics called ‘formal methods’. These three ideas turn on the first of them, since the scientific world view seems natural for the study of computing. The paper's thesis is that while software touches science in many ways, it does not itself have a significant scientific component. For understanding programming, for teaching it and for applying it in the world, science is the wrong model. Mathematics has found its own foundations apart from science, and computer science must do the same.";

bibo:abstract "Computer Science Education courses concentrate on the scientific education of computer science, while the Computer Science Program concentrates on computer science. Both of these study programs have a close relationship to complement and improve each other in the domain of science and education in the field of computer science (cross-fertilization principle). Knowledge management nowadays is still in concept level that hard to implement and still requires exploration and improvement to develop. Failure level in implementation of Knowledge Management System (KMS) high enough that should be measured with KMS Readiness Levels. This research uses analytical hierarchy process (AHP) weighting method and Aydin/Tasci scales to find out the research objective which is priority weighting from each of concepts that has been studied and to find out readiness category based on Aydin/Tasci Scale. The initial phase is to design a scale of measurement using AHP method with normalization weight and priority values as final results the next phase is to analyze the processing values using Aydin/Tasci Scale to see readiness scale of knowledge management system in computer science program. As measured from the readiness level of KMS are knowledge manager, technology and culture. Based on that, AHP weight values for each concept which chosen for this KMS readiness research in Computer Science Program. The highest score is 3.176 from culture dimension. Average value KMS readiness in Computer Science Program is 2,863 which means Computer Science Program is not ready yet for KMS implementation.";

In those days, the primary role of the electrical engineer was to design a machine that could carry out these computations with the greatest affordable speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. Shortly after, the same logical processes for symbol manipulation that enabled computers to do fast arithmetic were used to great advantage for handling, sorting, and processing alphanumeric information in the business world. This activity evolved into what has come to be known as data processing.";

bibo:abstract "Bangladesh is yet to produce adequate number of engineering professionals in the field of Computer Science.29 public, 54 private and 2 international universities aren't enough to allow more students in engineering and technical education. On the other hand, Bangladesh is still economically struggling and eastern patriarchal social barriers dominate the socio-cultural condition. Females of Bangladesh has been facing many visible and inherent obstacles in the way of earning higher education in technological discipline. The gender ratio of computer science education in undergraduate level in Bangladesh is 1:4, while in the IT sector the percentage of females goes down to less than 10%. In this paper, we have carried out an explorative study to investigate the complexities of these phenomena through qualitative research of Bangladeshi female students enrolled in computer science undergraduate program. We studied on a mixed sample of students who are deeply involved with computer science related activities and competitive programming. The study reveals that social barriers and economic issues quite hinder the smooth progress of an enthusiastic and potential female student of Computer science, while strong determination and family support take students to achieve their desired learning curve in computer science.";

bibo:abstract "As women belong to a minority in computer science, this work aims to provide possible K-12 STEM education initiatives how computer science faculties can contribute to increasing the proportion of women in computer science by using robots. Through applying these initiatives, faculties can help to reduce the gender imbalance, increase diversity and the amount of computer science specialists, who are requested immensely. Based on the results of conducted requirements elicitation a concept for programming an application with the NAO robot which trains vocabularies, as well as a concept with the Cozmo robot which piles up cubes, were developed. First tests were performed with female and male high school students. Either concept consists of an introduction of possible robotics application fields, a presentation explaining the Python program code of the concept as well as corresponding exercises with the robot and Python. Evaluation of the workshop concepts through questionnaires showed that both concepts have the potential to increase the proportion of women and to motivate female as well as male students for computer science. Moreover, recommendations for further robotics projects with respect to motivating young women for STEM can be made based on the insights of the requirements elicitation and the evaluation of the concepts. Nevertheless, further refinement and validation has to be undertaken. Long-term as well as short-term initiatives are feasible with the developed concepts. All participating schools showed high interest in both types of initiatives and further cooperation.";

dblp:publishedBy "OUP";
dbo:rank "20";
dblp:bibtexType "Journals";
bibo:abstract "This paper represents a personal view of the state of HCI as a design discipline and as a scientific discipline, and how this is changing in the face of new technological and social situations. Going back 20 years a frequent topic of discussion was whether HCI was a ‘discipline’. It is unclear whether this was ever a fruitful topic, but academic disciplines are effectively about academic communities and there is ample evidence of the long-term stability of the international HCI/CHI community. However, as in computer ‘science’, the central scientific core of HCI is perhaps still unclear; for example, a strength of HCI is the closeness between theory and practice, but the corresponding danger is that the two are often confused. The paper focuses particularly on the challenge of methodological thinking in HCI, especially as the technological and social context of HCI rapidly changes. This is set alongside two other challenges: the development of reliable knowledge in HCI and the clear understanding of interlinked human roles within the discipline. As a case study of the need for methodological thinking, the paper considers the use of single person studies in research and design. These are likely to be particularly valuable as we move from a small number of applications used by many people to a ‘long tail’ where large numbers of applications are used by small numbers of people. This change calls for different practical design strategies; focusing on the peak experience of a few rather than acceptable performance for many. Moving back to the broader picture, as we see more diversity both in terms of types of systems and kinds of concerns, this may also be an opportunity to reflect on what is core across these; potential fragmentation becoming a locus to understand more clearly what defines HCI, not just for the things we see now, but for the future that we cannot see.";

This article examines the arguments. My preliminary findings are that if you examine the arguments from a positivist stance, you may well infer that there is a crisis, but if you view them from a constructivist perspective, the crisis becomes an illusion. The article concludes by setting a research question, the outcome of which may establish more conclusively if the crisis is indeed true or illusory.";

In this paper, an attempt has been made to identify the “core” primary journals in the newly emerging discipline of computer science. Two measures of significance have been used to draw up a core list of journals: Productivity, in terms of the number of source items drawn from each journal for review in a secondary journal (Computing Reviews); and extent of use, as reflected by the frequency with which the journals are cited in a leading primary journal (IEEE Transactions on Computers) over a period of two years. This study has shown that the primary journal is the most favored medium for scholarly communication, and that computer science journal literature has consolidated into a relatively few very productive and highly cited primary journals. These core journals are indispensable in any specialized collection of computer science literature.";

bibo:abstract "This research WIP paper describes computer science undergraduate students' perceptions of career pathways and becoming K-12 computer science teachers. Computer science (CS) education has become critical with the rapid pace of technological development to better prepare students for national technology and economic competitiveness and security. According to Code.org, 57.5% of U.S. public high schools offer foundational computer science courses in 2023; unfortunately, access to the courses remains unequal and maintains wide disparities by race/ethnicity and social class. For instance, Hispanics are 1.4 times less likely to take foundational CS courses compared to their white and Asian peers, and students with low socio-economic status are underrepresented in the overall population. The shortage of CS teachers is one of the significant barriers to why minoritized groups of students do not have equal access to learning CS. Various programmatic efforts have been implemented to address the gap, including the recruitment of undergraduate students who will earn bachelor's degrees in computing. This approach has been considered innovative in building a new pipeline for producing highly qualified CS teachers with the ability to transform computing education and the CS teacher community rather than training in-service teachers certified in other disciplines to receive credentials to teach CS. Studies report that CS degree recipients opt for industry roles and exhibit disinterest in alternative career pathways, such as teaching because they perceive this profession as having lower salaries and unfavorable aspects associated with the job. However, we need a more prosperous and in-depth understanding of why CS degree holders consider industry jobs of greater importance rather than teaching, which would reduce the disparity in K-12 computing education. As a first attempt to better understand the perceptions of computer science undergraduate students at an Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), we collected qualitative data (i.e., student artifacts) in a course offered in the computer science department. Driven by social cognitive career and FIT-choice theory, our findings from the preliminary analysis indicate that CS undergraduate students at an HSI acknowledged the importance of K-12 CS teachers in their communities, but at the same time, they have more concerns about the underpayment and undervaluation of the job. They have shown a conflict between their perceptions of teaching CS and their own career aspirations as CS teachers. These preliminary findings draw attention to the importance of uncovering common career plans among CS undergraduate students.";

The origin of this development is geographic: Grenoble is located in the French Alps, where since the beginning of the century, hydroelectric dams have been built. Hence, electricity was available and cheap, and new industries settled in the region, with a strong demand for research in electrotechnology, fluid mechanics, and applied mathematics. An exception in France, Grenoble therefore has a sound tradition of close links between university and industry, particularly in fields at the roots of computer sciences.";

The objective of the project is to provide specific curricula guidance for programs offering an undergraduate major in the field of computing. The Task Force is convinced that all such undergraduate programs share a common core of subject matter that may be partitioned into the following subareas: (1) algorithms and data structures; (2) programming languages; (3) architecture; (4) numerical and symbolic computation; (5) operating systems; (6) software methodology and engineering; (7) databases and information retrieval; (8) artificial intelligence and robotics; and (9) human-computer communications. Each of these areas must be included in the background of any undergraduate major in a substantive way. The various parts of the course model are presented.<<ETX>>";

These factors have been used both individually and in combination as predictors in the social sciences and business studies [1, 7, 17]. However, very few studies investigate their effects in the area of computer science. This study focuses on capturing these factors across the four years of a computer science course at Trinity College, Dublin. It shows that as computer experience increases self-efficacy also increases while computer anxiety decreases with increasing experience";

bibo:abstract "Understanding computer system hardware is basic for the undergraduate student which study in the computer area. System user always needs a faster, cheap and reliable process which is conducted by it computer system self. To fulfill that process is required how a computer works from their design and how they operate. That course is conducted by Computer Architecture and Organization (CAO) course. Two computer undergraduate area which studies CAO is Computer Engineering (CE) and Computer Science (CS). To support great learning at CAO both CE and CS needs to not just study which has a material course but they had to practically study computer architecture and design by the simulator. Why simulator is chosen, because to create computer such as CPU, RAM etc. needs big systems that can manufacture them. Nowadays too much freely available simulator that can be downloaded and used anytime, but not all simulators meet study requirements and didn't meet the CAO Learning Outcome. CS and CE have an international curriculum that given by ACM Computing Curricula. So this paper is discussed what kind of simulator that meets Computing Curricula requirement to implement at learning process which helps the instructor to choose simulator that can be able to grasp knowledge that delivered to the student.";

bibo:abstract "This paper describes the development of a new software engineering curriculum at the University of Alabama. This curriculum is jointly administered by three separate academic programs: computer engineering, computer science and management information systems. These programs have combined to develop a unified software engineering track, consisting of an optional sequence of courses for majors in the three programs. Our software engineering track is characterized by two key elements: the use of software component engineering as a technical foundation, and the integration of students from the three participating programs into a single capstone laboratory. The capstone laboratory involves the development of a multifaceted product, requiring the interdisciplinary cooperation of all three groups of students to complete. This paper describes the design and conceptual foundations of this program, which has received funding from the National Science Foundation.";

To better understand the factors that discourage students, both males and females, from pursuing degrees in computer science, a valid and reliable survey is needed. This type of instrument would support the quantitative tracking of attitudinal changes with respect to the field overtime as well as attitudinal comparisons across various subpopulations. This paper describes a survey which is being developed based on current research in computer science education at the Colorado School of Mines through support of the National Science Foundation. Based on the results of a factor analysis and with respect to the pilot population (Colorado School of Mines undergraduate students), there is evidence to support the assertion that this instrument is accurately measuring the five constructs that it was designed to assess.";

The Science Perspective has helped in recruitment of students who otherwise might not have considered taking a computer science course. The assignments offered as part of the Science Perspective have been an integral part of our approach to teaching computer science in a way that is interesting and engaging to students by inviting them to explore scientific applications in computing. Our approach uses the Alice 3D animation-based programming environment followed by an event-based graphical Java programming approach. The interactive and visual nature of these approaches has increased student engagement, which has led to better retention in follow-up computer science courses. This approach could also be applicable in teaching computer science in secondary education.";

bibo:abstract "This Research-to-Practice Work in Progress paper presents a recent professional development for high school computer science teachers. The court system increasingly relies on algorithms to rate a criminal defendant's likelihood of recidivism. These algorithms utilize machine learning models tuned on biased datasets, resulting in false assessments. There are several other alerting examples of how a software engineer's personal bias affects their design and development of technology. This bias leads to poor usability of technology for underserved groups. Data science applies machine learning on massive datasets to invent new technology to improve everyday life from healthcare to consumer needs. Designing and developing data science solutions for a diverse population requires an unbiased approach. Data feminism, which emerges from the intersecting fields of data science and feminist theory, presents a methodology to solve data science problems given three principles: 1) invent new ways to represent data unknowns, 2) invent new ways to reference the material economy behind the data, 3) make dissent possible. In this paper, we present a case study on a week-long online professional development for computer science high school teachers on data science using a data feminist lens. We discuss the data science tools and technology taught during the weeklong event. We share examples of the data feminism principles and class exercises. The computer science teachers also participated in community building activities. The culminating weeklong challenge was to analyze an earthquake dataset, which included themes of socioeconomic disparity within a city. The teachers worked in teams to explore this dataset with the new data science techniques and recommend resource management solutions for a city's earthquake response. In this paper, we explore the question: how the participating computer science high school teachers incorporate data feminism into their data science pipeline? We analyze the audio transcripts collected during the week to create visual analytics on our findings. We consider the impacts of culturally responsive approaches to computer science K-12 curriculum and future professional development in this space.";

bibo:abstract "In this integrated STEM learning module we developed a data collection tool and used innovative analysis methods to investigate the relationship between academic achievement and risky wellness behaviors among college students. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed using data from college students (n = 1,499) at a large north-central university. Advanced machine learning analysis techniques found a strong connection between student wellness behavior and academic achievement and that this relationship can be predicted using wellness behavior data. The real world research project in this study integrated educational activities among Mathematics, Computer Science, and Health Science creating an interdisciplinary learning experience within Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).";

SBA Research, Software Competence Center Hagenberg, and VRVis Zentrum fuer Virtual Reality und Visualisierung, all funded by the Austrian COMET Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies program, each selected one science–industry partnership to exemplify how they do TCS in their day-to-day work. We show how the COMET funding program provides a framework for establishing long-term research relationships with industry, thus facilitating TCS: research done by the COMET centers is directly put in the practical context of the industry partners, and successes and failures are immediately reported back. This constant feedback loop positively impacts the know-how at the involved companies, while allowing the computer scientists to continuously test, improve, and publish their research based on real-world scenarios.";

bibo:abstract "The surge in data science courses highlights an educational shift towards incorporating data skills as a fundamental component of a well-rounded academic curriculum. This growth indicates a recognition of the critical role that data plays in shaping our understanding of complex issues in today's data-driven society. It also underscores the need for data science education to be accessible, representative, and tailored to a wide array of learners and professionals. The work to date to establish a data science foundational knowledge framework represents a pivotal step in formalizing and enhancing data science education. Yet, these frameworks have been largely designed for those pursuing data science careers. The field is in need of a data science framework that focuses on the essential introductory knowledge and skills for non-CS students to build a solid foundation in data science. This paper provides a description of the literature review process and experiences the research team has drawn from to develop such a framework. It also positions this framework for future research in studying effectiveness and alignment to the K-12 space.";

bibo:abstract "The University of Alabama has developed an integrated first-year curriculum for engineering students consisting primarily of an integrated block of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering design. While this curriculum is highly appropriate (and successful) for most engineering majors, it does not meet the needs of a computer engineering (or computer science) major nearly as well. Recognizing this, the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering received funding under NSF's Course and Curriculum Development Program to generate an integrated introduction to the discipline of computing. The revised curriculum provides a five-hour block of instruction (each semester) in computer hardware, software development, and discrete mathematics. At the end of this three-semester sequence, students will have completed the equivalent of CS I and CS II, a digital logic course, an introductory sequence in computer organization and assembly language, and a discrete mathematics course. The revised curriculum presents these same materials in an integrated block of instruction. As one simple example, the instruction of basic data types in the software course (encountered early in the freshman year) is accompanied by machine representation of numbers (signed binary, one and two's complement) in the hardware course, and by arithmetic in different bases in the discrete mathematics course. It also integrates cleanly with the Foundation Coalition's freshman year, and provides a block of instruction that focuses directly upon the discipline of computing.";

bibo:abstract "This paper describes the use of active and cooperative learning techniques in an introductory computer science (Java) course. During classroom sessions, the instructor had a computer/projector, but students had no computer access. The challenge was to teach programming to students who were not at computers. One technique involved completion of short programming exercises in small heterogeneous teams. A typical two-hour class might consist of several brief periods of instruction interspersed with 10- or 20-minute periods of team work. Teams shared their solutions with classmates using the whiteboard or overhead projector. The instructor demonstrated a working solution using the instructorpsilas computer/projector, and later put it on the class Web site for the studentspsila use. Another active/cooperative learning technique used was a daily quiz, which was completed by the student during class. Students were encouraged to work together on the quiz, or to ask questions about it during class. The quiz was used as an outline and reinforcement of the daypsilas topics, as well as a feedback mechanism for the instructor. Students also found the quizzes helpful as study tools. Both uses of active and cooperative learning served to make the sessions more valuable and enjoyable than in an ordinary lecture-format class.";

In addition, a variety of simulators are utilized to strengthen the material and help control the topic flow. The simulators used include a programmable logic array software package, a MIPS assembly simulator, and a locally created control code simulator. Teaching the two course sequence has been proven to be challenging.

The performance of the presented Pi cluster is assessed using two different applications of face recognition and image encryption, which are computationally expensive. The paper explains how to compare the performance of the Pi cluster against a traditional high performance traditional cluster. The comparison is designed to help undergraduate students understand the state of the art of the clusters. The paper explains how the Pi clusters fit in the CS curriculum at Old Dominion University.

bibo:abstract "The promise of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) was recognized long ago, but CAI is not widely used in college-level science and engineering curricula. Standup lectures remain the method of choice for delivering classroom instruction. In this paper, we describe an educational software package called ALECS (A Learning Environment for Computer Science). ALECS has been used in a first-semester computer science course to dramatically reduce the time devoted to standup lectures, which gives the instructor more time for tutoring. ALECS provides assistance in three areas: instruction, feedback and student tracking. We describe each of these areas and the changes ALECS enables in the structure of our courses and in the classroom.";

bibo:abstract "Our multimedia CD-ROM \"Computer Music: an Interactive Documentary\" was created as a vehicle to attract students, via the concepts of digital music, to pursue studies in computer science and engineering. \"Computer Music\" explores some of the basic principles of computing. We selected computer music as the central theme because music is popular with today's youth and because it offers an excellent vehicle for illustrating some of the basic principles of computer science and engineering. This CD-ROM for Macintosh and Windows platforms explains how computers \"make music\": the basics of analog to digital conversion, the effects of sampling rate and resolution, and employs over two hours of video and animation. It also offers detailed descriptions of the processing and flow of digital data in synthesis, sampling and MIDI music production. By investigating how computers are used to create, edit and perform music, students gain an understanding of how computers process and handle information. The CD-ROM pioneers a new medium, the interactive documentary. A new feature called \"Connex\" allows the user to enter an underground labyrinth where they will find editorial comments that draw together the complex concepts of computer music and where interrelated ideas may be accessed independently.";

However, in practice course syllabus are often far from playing this role. In this paper, we analyze several course syllabus in order to better characterize learning expectations in the field of HCI (Human Computer Interaction) and Computer Science. We start by analyzing variations of course syllabus descriptions in that field. We report the results of a case study using simple statistics to automatically extract relationships from syllabus documents of HCI courses described online. We further provide some requirements for future syllabus descriptions that seem to be missing in all the syllabus descriptions analyzed. Our aim with this work is to urge further discussions and future work to enhance the content and practice related to course syllabus.";

Older citizens feel isolated and sometimes lose their urge to live because they find difficulty in connecting with society and the latest development. Thus, their quality of life cannot be defined in terms of physical and mental health. This research tried to find out the benefits of computer literacy like being able to use online shopping, online banking, internet etc, for senior citizens in rural areas. For this, the researchers collected data from senior citizen to get an idea if they are really interested in such classes. Moreover, the researcher carried out an interview with Marketing and Community Relation Head at one of the prestigious universities in the UAE. The competencies like interpersonal relationships, establishing identity, purpose, integrity etc. are proven to enhance by community learning among students. The data collected resulted in stating community services to make senior citizens aware and efforts to improve their quality of life are beneficial in many ways.";

In Mexico, there is a great problem with the name of computer science and computer engineering education programs with at least eighty-four different names. For this reason, it was necessary to classify the programs in four profiles, according to the National Association of Institutions of Education in Computation (ANIEI). These profiles reflect the number of Mexican professionals per state and principle cities. An ANIEI rating of successful conclusions has been included for bachelor programs. Using these ratings, a prognosis is made for successful termination of studies for the entire country, including states and principle cities, until the year 2005. This leads the writers of the article to an analysis regarding the favorable regions for software development. Finally, a review of curriculum content for computer science and computer engineering education in Mexico is made, along with the level of competencies achieved.";

This school of thought does not realize that by this, it will take CE program apart from CS program, which will break the natural alliance of both of these programs. In this paper, this natural alliance of CE and CS programs is discussed, which gives strong argument that both CE and CS programs should be put together under the same college. To further support these arguments of putting CE and CS programs together, the best practices adopted in this regards by the top 10 universities in KSA, USA, UK and other European Universities are studied and results are provided to prove that CE and CS programs should be put together under the same college. Since, this is the current debate at AlBaha University in Saudi Arabia (KSA), therefore the case of AlBaha University is presented to settle the argument.";

bibo:abstract "In 1993, the University of Kansas merged the Department of Computer Science in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the School of Engineering. The resulting department, called the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), resides in the School of Engineering and brings together the broad fields of electrical technology computing, telecommunications and information science. Among other things, the merger enabled the consolidation of courses, enhanced classroom experiences for the students, and expanded research opportunities. The EECS Department now offers three Bachelor of Science degrees in electrical engineering, computer engineering and computer science, as well as masters and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. This paper first describes the philosophy we applied in developing the three programs as they now stand. We then describe the curricula themselves. We point out where the curricula are the same, where they are only similar and where they are distinctly different. Finally, we discuss future changes that we anticipate in the programs. We feel that the merger has created the opportunity for significantly improved teaching and research. This paper shares some of our experience and ideas.";

bibo:abstract "Despite extensive social changes and intensive political efforts to establish equal opportunities, women are still a minority in the fields of natural sciences and technology studies, as well as in the related professional fields. At the same time, technologically oriented studies are not per se less interesting for women, but their motivation, specific interests, learning styles, goals and demands often vary significantly from those of men. The rather broad interests of women often are directly opposed by a unilateral, outdated, techno-centric learning-/training program, which is not only unattractive to women (and an increasingly high number of men), but also bypasses the actual demands of modern education and the job market. The complexity of global markets, social reference, economical objectives and ecological limits call for integrated thought and action, which has to be mirrored in interdisciplinary approaches. A change within the curricula towards a support of non-technological basics and social skills would thus not only support the interests of women and men but also follow the demands of economy. The Galilea project, located at the Berlin University of Technology, is developing several models of co-educative, gender-sensitive model-courses within the three areas: natural sciences, computer sciences and engineering.";

bibo:abstract "As a fast-growing field with widespread impact on economy and its promising hiring potential, Data Science has been enthusiastically sought-out by many disciplines in the academia, including Mathematics, Statistics, Library Science, Management Information Systems, as well as Computer Science, as an attracting area for recruiting students, soliciting grants, and expanding their existing programs. Although some standalone programs in Data Science have been established around the country, many institutions encounter the challenges in balancing the curricula among different disciplines, allocating new resources, and cooperating with the existing majors regarding enrollment management, student advising, and faculty preparation. In this paper, a strategy-based framework is proposed for those who have limited resources of all kinds to introduce Data Science through their existing Computer Science programs at a baccalaureate level with a minimum curriculum disruption. Instead of a standalone program, to embed Data Science into Computer Science education is demonstrated to be a practical, effective, cost-saving approach based on an extensive study of the synergy between Data Science and Computer Science education. While the proposed framework is not a one-size-fits-all approach, it provides a doable route for blending Data Science into Computer Science education in systematic ways. It has become the consensus that an adequate exposure to Data Science will better prepare computer science students for taking the challenges in this ever-changing, data embraced world.";

bibo:abstract "There have been many discussions on the significant lack of representation of minorities in computing. Research suggests that an attributing factor to this deficit is a lack of exposure to computing, computing careers, and underrepresented role models. Introducing underrepresented minority students to hands-on computer science activities at an early age is believed to improve students' attitudes in computing. Increasing students' computing attitudes may help encourage participation and minimize deficiencies in retaining underrepresented minority computing students. An interactive summer program was implemented to teach computing to middle-school-aged underrepresented minority students through a unique curriculum using Sphero robotic balls and math and science concepts. Students were assessed to determine the programs' effectiveness in increasing computing attitudes and academic performance of math and science. Results showed that the intervention significantly improved students' academic performances and their confidence in deciding a future career path. Further evaluation is needed to explore longitudinal effects of the varying levels of math, science, and computing rigor used within this intervention. Findings from this study provide recommendations for how to implement computing practices within the existing math and science curriculum in prospective initiatives.";

bibo:abstract "The aim of our paper is to provide good practices for teaching data science to non-computer science students and find out how we can motivate female students to take MINT (Mathematics, Computer science, Natural science and Technology) classes. The analyzed data science course is offered at University of Vienna in the Business Analytics, Data Science, and Digital Humanities faculties as part of the masters' programs. In this work, we outline the course structure and present findings gained through teaching it. Moreover, we highlight the main differences between the editions of the course. Anonymous surveys, grade analysis, and student interviews, show that female students achieved the same learning outcomes as their male peers in all the terms as measured by the total score and all three sub-scores, namely the project submission, the mid-term quiz, and the final quiz. In 2020 and 2021, no significant differences could be found in student performance by their attended study program. In 2022, a difference could be found in the midterm exam; however, no significant difference could be found in the final exam and the project work, indicating that the course was able to harmonize the learners' diverse background. This suggests that the diverse learning opportunities offered in this course fit the individual needs of students of different backgrounds, which increases the accessibility of the data science field among non-computer science students. We propose the course as described in this paper as a good practice of teaching 21st century digital skills in a studentcentered way and conclude the paper with five recommendations.";

bibo:abstract "This Full Paper in the Research-To-Practice Category illustrates what an online survey of students’ opinions reveals about students’ perceived learning and take-away from a course on Data Science. The course is offered at University of Vienna in the Business Analytics, Data Science, and Digital Humanities faculties as part of the masters’ programs. In this work, we outline the course structures, goals, modules, and present preliminary findings gained while teaching the course. Due to the global pandemic and resulting lock-downs, the course was held online, hence, we also analyze the effects of the current situation on the students.The results revealed that the structure of the course is appreciated by the students. Furthermore, the students liked the open source software taught in the course where they can create visual workflows with an intuitive, drag-and-drop style graphical interface, without the need for coding. The results also confirmed our hypothesis which showed that working in groups is more complex and difficult using online tools. We learn that the instructor-generated technique for forming the groups assigning to each group students with different backgrounds, lead to teams that are able to solve problems faster as they are more cognitively diverse. These findings confirm that the approach used in the Data Science course is viable for teaching computer science skills to non computer-scientist and can be used by other educational institutions.";

Instruments in Spanish are crucial to assess SI in Spanish-speaking Latinx students. SI instruments in general, do not measure the identity of computer science (CS) or mathematics majors nor are they in Spanish. To address this need, SISE was adapted for CS and mathematics. Using a mixed method approach the instrument’s content validity and reliability was determined. Exploratory factor analysis showed items for the new Survey of Math and Computer Science Identity (EIMIC2) fall into three factors related to SI dimensions of competence, recognition, and performance.";

A search of the literature found 22 effect sizes (involving 1,447 participants) that met the pre-defined inclusion criteria. Although most of the ITS were used to teach programming, other topics such as database design and computer literacy were also represented. There was a significant overall effect size favoring the use of ITS. There was a significant advantage of ITS over teacher-led classroom instruction and non-ITS computer-based instruction. ITS were more effective than the instructional methods to which they were compared regardless of whether they modeled misconceptions and regardless of whether they were the primary means of instruction or were an integrated component of learning activities that included other means of instruction.";

bibo:abstract "Graphs are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can be used to model many types of relations and process dynamics in computer science, physical, biological and social systems. Many problems of practical interest can be represented by graphs. In general graphs theory has a wide range of applications in diverse fields. This paper explores different elements involved in graph theory including graph representations using computer systems and graph-theoretic data structures such as list structure and matrix structure. The emphasis of this paper is on graph applications in computer science. To demonstrate the importance of graph theory in computer science, this article addresses most common applications for graph theory in computer science. These applications are presented especially to project the idea of graph theory and to demonstrate its importance in computer science.";

In an effort to reverse that trend at Mississippi State University, we have instituted pair programming for the laboratory exercises in the introductory programming course. This paper describes a study performed to analyze whether using pair programming would increase retention. An important goal of this study was not only to measure increased retention, but to provide insight into why retention increased or decreased. The results of the study showed that retention significantly increased for those students already majoring in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or Computer Engineering. In addition, survey results indicated that the students viewed many aspects of pair programming to be very beneficial to their learning experience.";

Our database contains a set of 15000 images. Word images are scanned and converted to image format to prepare them for subsequent processing steps. Preprocessing techniques were applied to the images to decrease the variability of colors, contrast, and brightness often presented in handwritten word images. This database is designed for the training and testing of handwritten French word recognition systems. Furthermore, the CSVD database can constitute an opportunity for other researchers to evaluate their recognition methods and systems.";

This paper presents a team effort to implement Collaborative Project-based Learning (CPBL) using Tablet PC technology in a broad spectrum of engineering and computer science courses from freshman to senior level. Presented here are a number of innovative teaching strategies to create a more friendly and interactive learning environment to address the aforementioned challenges for minority students. Since Fall 2009, eight innovative pilot courses have been designed and conducted. Assessment results revealed that the implementation of Tablet PC based CPBL had brought transformational changes to the traditional engineering classrooms to support student centered-learning. The paper also describes the impact of Tablet PC based teaching strategy on lecture styles, teaching effectiveness and student learning outcomes from both the faculty and students' perspectives.";

bibo:abstract "Teaching in higher education can be rewarding, but also stressful. Different teaching approaches and paradigms may mean that teachers are constantly trying to improve the learning experience for their students — a good thing; but perhaps are not succeeding — a bad thing. This paper is essentially a story centring around a teaching experience I had over the course of a single semester. Motivated by a desire to improve the interactivity in a computer science class, I designed and implemented an initiative to facilitate student interaction and teamwork: a flipped classroom. The initiative was not as successful as hoped for, and so I drew on reflexivity and autoethnography to help understand and learn from the experience.";

bibo:abstract "Programming is a complex intellectual activity. We observed through the years that it is difficult for some students to understand the logic of a program and to familiarize themselves with the control structures. In order to help smooth this initial relationship with programming, we tried Scratch (a programming language designed for young people, developed by MITpsilas Media Lab). We analyze the use of Scratch in two Computer Science 1 courses: one in university degree and other in vocational studies. We use this tool in the very first weeks of those courses with the purpose of improving studentspsila programming experiences and motivation, and also to detect its influence, if any, in scores and dropout rates in comparison with normal courses. We developed detailed lab guides, exercises, tests and questions forms. We contrast the results with normal courses and found that students who used Scratch expressed higher motivation but there was no statistically evidence of differences neither in dropout rates nor obtained scores. In this paper we present the detailed courses, the experimentation and the results. We offer some conclusions and reflections over the particular value of including this kind of tool. We include suggestions with the intention of improving Scratch.";

bibo:abstract "Despite rapid growth and the promise of a lucrative degree, the attrition rate for students studying Computer Science is high. Computer Science learning is a difficult, tedious process with a heavy workload which demands a lot from those studying it. A student who loses motivation or interest in the field is more likely to find a new area of study. In order to keep students interested and motivated, difficult concepts need to be taught in new, more engaging and interactive ways that feel fun. Students are willing to take on hard, frustrating, and even time-consuming challenges within video games for intangible rewards and feelings of accomplishment. Therefore, our goal is to gamify Computer Science learning to achieve the same levels of engagement and fulfillment as video games do. To do so, we have begun development of a serious game that introduces CS concepts in a fun and interactive way. To measure the level of interest and engagement brought on by this game, we let volunteers from CS as well as in other majors play our prototype. After playing the games, each volunteer filled out a survey comparing their enjoyment in learning through games as opposed to traditional classroom learning. With this feedback we concluded that gamification is key in changing the learning experience for CS students and will help them achieve their learning goals.";

bibo:abstract "This research project aims to investigate, how young men and women differ regarding (1) their perceptions of Computer Science (CS) as a scientific discipline respectively as a professional field and (2) the experiences that had influenced their choice of major subject. For that purpose, we conducted a biographical study of CS freshmen at university. In total, 217 students (54 female, 163 male) participated on the survey. The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool. All these differences seem to influence the selection of the major subject of the students. They might explain the problem of low enrollment rates in Computer Science and the decreasing number of students in core Computer Science in comparison to the more interdisciplinary courses of study.";

We give very simple proofs that these recursive functions have exponential time complexity. The proofs are appropriate for coverage in the first computer science course.";

Students consistently ranked the visualization software as more important to their learning than any other element of the course. However, these rankings were not highly correlated with actual outcomes. This study of learning style determined that reflective and verbal learners outperformed active and visual ones. Student opinions of the value of programming projects and lectures rank highest and seem to cut across learning style preference. Background familiarity with computers and software was not a strong correlate, although involvement in computer and video gaming was found to be negatively correlated with course success.";

bibo:abstract "Agile software methodologies are quickly becoming widely used in a variety of industry projects; their flexibility provides the means to address many common problems faced in the development of software systems. Companies commonly use selected agile techniques such as unit testing, pair programming, and iterative development even if a complete methodology is not yet embraced. As these techniques become more and more prevalent in industry, it is becoming essential that they are incorporated into traditional computer science curricula. Many aspects of agile methodologies can be regarded as standard practice but taken to an extreme. Consequently, although there are some agile practices that would have to be added to a traditional curriculum, there are many that are typically already covered to a limited extent. Webster University has developed an Agile Software Development graduate course in which the main ideas are discussed, and implemented via student projects. We describe some of the key agile techniques and how they are taught in the Agile course, how we resolve the numerous challenges faced by teaching these techniques, and report on how these ideas are woven into the graduate program.";

bibo:abstract "Given the growing demand for skilled workers from the Computer Science field, the high attrition rate of entering Computer Science students is a serious problem at most universities. Much research exists on evaluating the reasons of failure with the introductory Computer Science curriculum referred to as the CS1, CS2 and CS3 courses. Current research has proposed methods to predict patterns and characteristics to offer early detection of students likely to fail. The problem is difficult to understand due to the existence of many possible reasons students drop-out from the computer science curriculum. Factors such as student transfers, course diversity, and students repeating failed courses are seldom considered. The goal of this paper is to extend the understanding of the attrition rates for entering Computer Science students by analyzing the progress of student success through 10 years of course data. The impact of transfer students is considered as well as the frequency students repeat the CS1, CS2, and CS3 courses, and their success. Analysis is done by following the students up until graduation. An analysis is also made to determine how courses tend to predict the graduation success rate.";

Device design constraints allow for very low cost of the built prototypes (5 - 10 € per device). We used NodeMCU with ESP8266 as a hardware platform. Lua as a part of NodeMCU firmware was used as a programming language due to simple syntax, possible interactive use, and compact source code that consisted of about 150 lines of code on average for each device. Pupils were provided with source code templates and encouraged to supplement the code with missing parts.

Evaluations regarding effectiveness of the e-Learning system used by lecturers have been made. However, the students have not evaluated yet the user experience while using the system. The materials posted in SCELE include PowerPoint slides, multimedia contents, and enrichment materials (e.g., links to online articles). Most of lecturers use discussion forums in their courses to encourage students to participate in active learning setting. Staff and lecturers sometimes post academic-related announcements on the SCELE homepage. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the user experience while students use the SCELE. A multi-methods approach is used to conduct the study. 113 students enrolled in Computer Science program were invited to evaluate SCELE. This study will benefit program and center of learning resources administrators, and learning management system developers to enhance the presence of e-Learning system in their institutions. Findings of the current study may also be valuable for universities and high schools which are using computer-based learning environments.

The Scratch-based CS0 course was developed to keep the students who had a desire to major in computer science engaged in the department, as well as prepare them for success in future computer science courses. This paper discusses the formal study that was conducted on the CS0 course offerings in Fall 2009 and Fall 2010, which reached about 120 students total, and over 60 in the target group of freshman CS majors with low mathematics placement scores. The study examined the course's effectiveness at improving the retention, performance and attitudes of these at-risk majors.";

bibo:abstract "Testing accounts for about half of the cost of software, but testing receives little treatment in most curricula. This paper presents an approach to giving students experiences in software testing throughout the curriculum, rather than the usual approach of offering a separate course in testing. The centerpiece of the authors' approach is the Software TestLab, which exists to train selected students in the art and science of testing, and to transfer testing practice into core courses. TestLab students become agents of technology transfer. This paper describes the conceptual framework used to define the set of essential test experiences, and presents lessons learned, to date.";

bibo:abstract "Pex4Fun (http://www.pexforfun.com/) is a web-based serious gaming environment for teaching computer science. Pex4Fun can be used to teach and learn computer programming at many levels, from high school all the way through graduate courses.With Pex4Fun, a student edits code in any browser -- with Intellisense -- and Pex4Fun executes it and analyzes it in the cloud. Pex4Fun connects teachers, curriculum authors, and students in a unique social experience, tracking and streaming progress updates in real time. In particular, Pex4Fun finds interesting and unexpected input values that help students understand what their code is actually doing. The real fun starts with Coding Duels where students write code to implement a teacher's specification. Pex4Fun finds any discrepancies in behavior between the student's code and the specification. This tutorial instructs materials to equip participants with skills and knowledge of using Pex4Fun in teaching and learning, such as solving puzzles, solving Coding Duels, exploring course materials in feature courses, creating and teaching a course, creating and publishing Coding Duels, and learning advanced topics behind Pex4Fun.";

bibo:abstract "From empirical data on the authorship of scientific papers, Alfred Lotka deduced an inverse-square law relating the number of authors of scientific papers to the number of papers written by each author. A basic assumption underlying Lotka's law is that the number of papers published by a scientist is a measure of his contribution to science. This assumption is debatable. In this paper Lotka's law is applied to the literature of computer science. The inconsistent results of earlier attempts to apply Lotka's law to the literature of various scientific disciplines, including computer science, are ascribed to the differences in sampling procedure and treatment of multiple authorship.";

This pedagogy showed positive results and broader acceptance by students in several semesters of intervention. Significant usage of mobile devices during class motivates the extension of this pedagogical approach of asynchronous problem solving using mobile devices. We believe that use of such devices in the classroom for solving interactive problems will enhance student's abilities to solve problems by using their preferred interaction mode. This paper presents the results of the evidence based pedagogy and development of a mobile classroom response system that extends this pedagogy to help student solve interactive problems in their mobile devices to improve their class engagement and problem solving skills.";

bibo:abstract "The paper describes the experience of using undergraduate students as peer learning assistants (PLAs) in different undergraduate computer science courses which have graduate teaching assistants (TAs) as well. Depending on the course, PLAs have some of the following roles - holding office hours, helping with the labs and tutorials, facilitating student group work in class. The impact of PLAs on student learning outcomes is assessed by comparing student grades in the offerings of the course with and without PLAs and comparing the numbers of student visits outside of the class meeting times to the instructor, to the TAs, and to the PLAs. In addition to that, questionnaires are used to solicit feedback from students and PLAs about their experience. We find that the use of PLAs results in statistically significant increase in student course grades and decrease in the number of non-passing grades. Student experiences with PLAs are very positive. Many students prefer to seek help from the PLAs rather than from the TAs or instructor. PLAs report that the experience was beneficial to them, too. The paper discusses benefits of using PLAs, student preferences regarding PLAs and TAs, and what practices worked best.";

Data from 377 subjects enrolled in CS0 breadth-first courses over three years were used to assess the reliability and construct validity of the instrument. A principal factor analysis, with Varimax rotation, produced a six factor solution that closely aligned with the constructs of Bandura's (1986) self-efficacy model. The self-efficacy group analysis used participant factor scores that were calculated by adding the sum of Likert-type responses to items associated with each of the six derived factors. Subjects received a success, no-success designation based on final course grade. Significant differences were found between the factor scores of: success, no-success groups; males and females; males and females in success group; and males in success, no-success groups.";

bibo:abstract "A considerable body of research examines people's perceptions of the nature of science. There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.";

We taught a “MathDance&Music” program to seventh grade students using the Scratch 2.0 creative learning environment. Students were given assessments before and after the MathDance&Music program. The assessment results show that the MathDance&Music program improved students' ability in math and computer science significantly as well as increased students' interest in STEM classes and interest in pursuing a career in STEM. Students who repeated the MathDance motions and coded the music for the dance did better on the math and computer science test in the assessment with statistically significant p-value than those students who did not repeat the MathDance motions and did not code the music for the MathDance.";

We developed software process activities and implemented them in a laboratory in conjunction with the third course of the computer science major. Students used practices such as postmortem analysis and measurement-based planning to gain control over their program development activities. Students kept electronic design notebooks that included pre/post surveys and postmortems on activities. Students used the data from their programming projects, collected during reviews and postmortems, in planning the next project. We used cognitive apprenticeship techniques so that students could not only understand the concepts but be able to apply them. At the end of the course surveys of the students indicated that they had (a) understood the software process concepts, (b) changed their own practices, (c) appreciated the value of such practices and (d) increased their commitment to a software engineering career. The laboratory developed in this project is not tied to a particular content but is generally applicable to any course with programming projects.";

bibo:abstract "In a course environment, pairing a student with one partner for the entire semester is beneficial, but may not be optimal. We conduct a study in two undergraduate level courses to observe the advantages and disadvantages of pair rotation whereby a student pairs with several different students throughout the semester. We summarize teaching staff and student perceptions on the viability of pair rotation. Teachers find pair rotation valuable because the teaching staff can obtain multiple peer evaluations on each student and because dysfunctional pairs are regularly disbanded. However, pair rotation adds to the burden of assigning pairs multiple times per semester. The majority of students in the study perceived pair rotation to be a desirable approach. Additionally, most students considered peer evaluation to be an effective means of providing feedback to teaching staff. However, they did not significantly believe that peer evaluation was an effective means for motivating students.";

bibo:abstract "Nowadays, resources on the web increase considerably. In this immense data warehouse, current information retrieval systems do not allow users to obtain results to their requests that meet exactly their needs. Mainly this is due to indexing techniques used (key words, thesaurus). In order to improve the relevance of information retrieval, an ontology-based approach called OBIREX is proposed in this paper. OBIREX is based on the use of ontology of the domain for indexing a collection of documents and the use of semantic links between documents to allow the inference of all relevant documents. This approach is tested on the domain of e-learning of computer science in the context of the semantic web. Some results obtained are also presented.";

bibo:abstract "Artificial intelligence will play an imperative role in meeting the challenges posed by the fourth industrial revolution. This paper discusses how artificial intelligence can be incorporated into engineering and computer science education to prepare for the fourth industrial revolution in South Africa. The paper firstly examines how artificial intelligence can be incorporated into the engineering curriculum to equip engineers and computer scientists with the necessary skills to solve the complex problems that the fourth industrial revolution will bring. These range from online courses and short courses with certification that can be taken by practitioners, to degrees in artificial intelligence and data science. Artificial intelligence can also be used in the teaching and learning of engineering courses. The paper looks at the use of intelligent tutoring systems and teaching assistants to provide individualised tuition to students, artificial intelligence in blended learning and the use of artificial intelligence techniques for data analytics to identify learning difficulties. The paper also examines mechanisms and a case study for involving industry in engineering education. It provides an overview of initiatives at a South African university, namely, the establishment of research chairs, to promote collaboration with industry in education and industry projects at the undergraduate, Honours, Masters, and Phd levels. The paper examines the role that artificial intelligence can play in peace engineering education and concludes by identifying rubrics to assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in engineering education.";

bibo:abstract "Teaching a statistics course for undergraduate computer science students can be extremely challenging: As statistics teachers we are usually faced with problems ranging from a complete disinterest in the subject to lack of basic knowledge in mathematics and anxiety for failing the exam, since statistics has the reputation of having high failure rates. In our case, we additionally struggle with difficulties in the timing of the lectures as well as often occurring absence of the students due to spare-time jobs or a long traveling time to the university. This paper reveals how these issues can be addressed by the introduction of a blended learning module in statistics. In the following, we describe an e-learning development process used to implement time- and location-independent learning in statistics. The study focuses on a six-step-approach for developing the blended learning module. In addition, the teaching framework for the blended module is presented, including suggestions for increasing the interest in learning the course. Furthermore, the first experimental in-class-usage has been completed and the outcome is discussed.";

bibo:abstract "We have explored the use of peer learning in a large, introductory data structures course within our computer science curriculum. The principal peer learning activities are group programming projects where each student group is assisted by a trained upper-class undergraduate peer learning assistant (PLA). The PLAs are consultants to the group to help facilitate group interaction and support group and individual questions. This paper describes the use of group programming projects in the course and studies their use in three instances of the course over a four year period. Each of these courses was taught by the same professor during the same time in each academic year. Each course was taught with the same group programming project model, but with variations in the number of students, how the groups were organized and the number of PLAs that were used. Overall, we feel the introduction of group programming projects in this large introductory course has been beneficial to students, PLAs, TAs and faculty. The students are able to legitimately work with peers to solve problems and learn the material. Peers are more able to provide a student perspective in answering questions. The results shown, in the paper indicate the long-term viability of such an approach. The approach has continued to rate well with students through variations in how it is used.";

bibo:abstract "Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need for all students in primary and secondary education to learn computer science (CS) concepts and skills. Educational games hold significant potential to serve as a platform for CS education because they integrate engaging problem solving with effective pedagogical strategies. This potential is especially high for narrative-centered educational games that embed learning activities within rich interactive stories. In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students' game-based learning activities. Building on these findings, we discuss design implications for creating student-adaptive CS learning experiences in educational games that incorporate block-based programming enriched narrative-centered gameplay.";

Instructors and students can play a key role in these communities of learning by creating and/or using Open Educational Resources (OERs). In 2016 two new discipline-specific communities were created within the MERLOT OER user community: Information Systems and Information Technology (IT/IS), and Computer Science (CS). The OER taxonomies for these, predicated on the CSAB/ABET curricula were a key factor in the endorsement of these communities and their portals, by the IEEE Computer Society and the IEEE Education Society. This paper describes the process of creation of both communities with the aim of establishing Editorial Boards to peer review OERs in these disciplines. Moreover, some analytics of the recently-created IT Editorial Board in MERLOT are presented as well.";

Students attend the program on campus at the University of Southern California, experiencing life as a college student while learning about a valuable field that is currently in high demand. The camps have a proven record of drawing interest from groups that are under- represented in computer science: girls (over 40% attended), minorities (over 70% attended), and low income families (over 80% of attendees with an annual family income less than $40k). Although a majority of the attendees expressed interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields prior to attending camp, the camps further increased interest by over 12%. We conclude that exposure programs such as CS@SC serve an important purpose, that of increasing the diversity and number of students pursuing education and careers in STEM fields.";

bibo:abstract "Software testing is essential to ensure software quality. On most software projects testing activities consume at least 30 percent of the project effort. On safety critical applications, software testing can consume between 50 to 80 percent of project effort. There is a vast amount of information available on software testing techniques and tools and some universities offer software testing courses at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level. Software testing must also be stressed in beginning courses and even in the high schools when students are first learning to program. It is also important in these early years to instill a respect for software testing and some interest in possible testing careers. This paper describes a project to develop a learning and training environment that enables students to develop the knowledge and skills to perform requirement based testing. The target audience for the environment are beginning programming students at either the high school or university level. The software training environment consists of Web-based instructional materials as well as a testing simulator which enables students to actually test software programs. This paper describes the educational objectives of the test training environment, its implementation and results from utilizing the environment with beginning programming students.";

bibo:abstract "Computer science knowledge in the 8th grade in Hungary was analysed, in order to see the differences in informatics skills of students from different school types. The student's knowledge should be level with each other at the end of primary stage, not depending on school type, because their learning material is based on the National Curriculum: this was the starting hypothesis. Why is this important? Because teachers at grammar schools have to know the knowledge of entering students; what have they to teach for all of them, do they have to group students according to their knowledge level, is there any difference in knowledge level by school types, if so, does it require a special course to smooth differences or not? An analysis of informatics skills by schooltypes in primary stages was made with the help of a web based Informatics Test. An on-line test based on the Hungarian National Curriculum was composed, and answers were analysed how effectively could students from different grades deal with different subjects. Over 60 teachers used the test to measure the knowledge level of more than 1000 students from various towns of Hungary. This time only those answers were needed which came from the 8th grade. After evaluating the test results the correctness of the original presumption emerged. First the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test was used to see if the results of the various groups showed standard normal distribution or not. The means of the correct answers by school types were examined using an Independent samples tests and the calculated Eta-squared revealed how school types influenced the differences of means. Significance level was 5% throughout the analysis. Significant divergence by school types was not found showing the original hypothesis correct. Further, some differences were found between the taught material and that of the National Curriculum.";

Furthermore, this research investigates whether the Entry Method and the Gender attributes have a significant influence on decision making in the data classification process. The result shows a higher average accuracy by using C4.5 algorithm with an accuracy rate of 77.01% compared to Random Tree (74.70%) and REPTree (76.75%). The Entry Method and Gender attributes have been proven to negatively influence the accuracy, thus omittance of these attributes is suggested.";

bibo:abstract "This innovative practice work-in-progress paper presents a pedagogical device, supported by a tool, moving evaluations at the heart of the learning process. The device gives back to students the control over their own learning and provides them with real-time feedback about their progress. Instructors can also monitor the progress of their classrooms. Designing a proper evaluation is not an easy task for instructors. It must make sense to students and should be adapted to the way they learn. Students are often quite afraid, stressed and not motivated by evaluations whose main perceived role is to achieve a decent grade to succeed the course. The method presented in this paper follows a competency based assessment approach. Each course's objectives are described with a list of competencies to get. Students have to prove they master them by passing evaluations ranging from simple quizzes to projects, including missions, codings and oral interviews. Students can choose the assessments to work on, that best suit their own way of learning. They can present them at their own pace. The proposed pedagogical device and associated developed tool are being tested for the first time during this 2019-2020 academic year. It has been proposed to second-year bachelor to master computer science engineering students, on classrooms with between 17 and 34 people. First feedback collected from students is globally positive and engaging, and the system will undergo a more formal and thorough evaluation.";

bibo:abstract "Pex4Fun from Microsoft Research is a web-based serious gaming environment for teaching computer science. Pex4Fun can be used to teach and learn computer programming at many levels, from high school all the way through graduate courses. With Pex4Fun, a student edits code in any browser - with Intellisense - and Pex4Fun executes it and analyzes it in the cloud. Pex4Fun connects teachers, curriculum authors, and students in a unique social experience, tracking and streaming progress updates in real time. In particular, Pex4Fun finds interesting and unexpected input values that help students understand what their code is actually doing. The real fun starts with coding duels where students write code to implement a teacher's specification. Pex4Fun finds any discrepancies in behavior between the student's code and the specification. This tutorial equips participants with skills and knowledge of using Pex4Fun in teaching and learning, such as solving puzzles, solving coding duels, exploring course materials in feature courses, creating and teaching a course, creating and publishing coding duels, and learning advanced topics behind Pex4Fun.";

This is achieved through the management of the Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and their functionalities. Many LMSs contain functionality that virtualizes the course's theoretical part in the classroom but not addressing the technical part. In this direction and to support the Computer Science Education (CSE), the virtual lab has emerged as an adopted environment which could be integrated into the LMS environment. This paper proposes two integration approaches (e.g. Web-Based Approach and Service-Oriented Approach) those can be used to prepare and integrate the virtual lab for CSE into the LMSs (e.g. Moodle).";

bibo:abstract "The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY, decided to standardize its computer science program on the unified modeling language (UML) for all software design representations. Converting the appropriate courses to support formal teaching or reinforcement of UML concepts was planned as a phased approach over four academic years. Formal UML instruction was planned for Computer Science 1 courses and the senior two-course software engineering capstone sequence. Reinforcement of UML would be in the intervening courses. Once implementation began, it became apparent that a prolonged period between formal blocks of instruction was insufficient. Instead, some additional courses were redesigned to support formal UML instruction. The end result was a richer and deeper exposure to UML than anticipated over the same timeframe.";

The results, based on a 17.4 % response rate, indicate that the most frequent English-language tasks for computer specialists in the professional workplace in Japan are the reading of manuals and instructions (for installation, etc.), and the writing of email, faxes, and business letters. English-language speaking and listening tasks are reported by respondents to be not as common in the workplace as English-language writing and reading tasks. Findings suggest that academic institutions training engineers in non-English-language environments should avoid an institutional bias toward English for research purposes by balancing curricula between future professional and workplace needs of the majority of graduates and the needs of faculty for trained graduate students within the academy.";

bibo:abstract "This paper first presents the difficulties for a classical university in Africa in general and in Senegal in particular, to carry out practical work in class, i.e. from a local laboratory or a physical location. These difficulties are linked to several economic, material and human factors. Thus, this paper first proposes to study a model of laboratories for online practical work applicable in several areas of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Then, for the practical implementation of the laboratory, the authors are interested in practical computer science work for development and network environments. The objective of this paper is therefore to implement a virtual laboratory that will allow students to create remote work in IT using the cloud to improve the performance, availability and scalability of existing practical work. The type of laboratory proposed is essentially based on virtual machines accessible via a web platform created and connected with the cloud that contains these virtual machines. It is also dynamic and flexible, i.e. the teacher, from this platform, first makes a request to the cloud administrator to create machines for a specific type of practical work for a group of students. Then, the teacher places in the platform the instructions of the practical work visible to the students. At this stage, the students will connect to the platform for the realization of the practical work with virtual machines following the instructions given by the teacher. The teacher’s monitoring and supervision of the practical work in synchronous or asynchronous mode is also ensured. The integration of WebRTC technology allows instant discussion between the learner and the teacher during practical work.";

bibo:abstract "Traditionally, computer science curricula focus on teaching technical content, either ignoring the importance of interpersonal communication or relegating it to separate courses with no integration of communication and technical skills. Thus, students get little practice with communication of technical information and even less appreciation for its importance. For the past several years one of the computer science senior design courses at NC State University has emphasized teaming, process, and professional communication skills in the context of industrially sponsored technical projects. Even though the instructors repeatedly emphasize the importance of communication and process, students are resistant to focus on the more social aspects of problem solving, desiring instead to dive in and solve the technical problems. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of cross-functional teams in an educational setting, identifying communication issues related to coordinating projects and exploring novel opportunities for non-traditional undergraduate education.";

Through a literature review, the current research on the use of AI in computer science education is summarized and gaps in the current literature are identified. The paper argues that with proper planning and support, the integration of AI tools in computer science education can enhance the curriculum and prepare students for both programming education and literature education. The limitations of ChatGPT and related AI tools are also discussed, including ethical implications and potential effects on teaching style and undergraduate research. The results of a simple survey show the current level of knowledge and usage of ChatGPT among faculty and undergraduate students in computer science majors. The paper concludes that while there are challenges to overcome, such as ethical concerns, an optimistic attitude towards the integration of AI into undergraduate computer science education can lead to positive outcomes and prepare students for the workforce.";

bibo:abstract "Although many software engineering (SE) and computer science (CS) texts use case studies to explain the different concepts, these case studies tend to focus on a specific subject such as object oriented design and implementation or requirements analysis and specification. In addition, these case studies usually lack instructor guidelines on how to use the material in teaching these concepts. The Digital Home Case Study addresses these issues by providing a complete set of artifacts associated with software development, and an extensive set of case study exercises for teaching different topics in software engineering and computer science, as well as guidance for instructors on how to use these case modules. In this paper, we motivate the use of the case study approach in teaching SE and CS concepts. We provide a description of the Digital Home case study and the associated artifacts and case modules. We also report on our use of the developed material.";

bibo:abstract "As a discipline, computer science has seen many dramatic changes. The content of the curriculum has for the most part kept pace with these changes. However the pedagogy has changed very little. Most computer science instruction uses the lecture method as the exclusive means of teaching the fundamentals of the material and out-of-class programming assignments to ensure appropriate programming skills are developed. In most cases, students learn to write short programs from scratch, by themselves. Compare this with the real world where programs are thousands or millions of lines long, are often extensively modified and maintained rather than merely constructed, are manipulated in a tool-rich environment, where work is almost always a team effort, and where the form of a solution has profound impact on future cost and performance. This clearly illustrates the problem. There is a serious mismatch between what is taught, how it is taught, and the emphasis it receives on one hand and what the consumers of the education actually need on the other. The University of Virginia began an ambitious undergraduate computer science curriculum revision in 1992. We discuss how we incorporated a cooperative learning environment into our new curriculum.";

bibo:abstract "In this era of technology and science, data skills are critical for full participation in the workforce and contemporary society. Alarmingly not all graduates exit college with what are nothing less than survival skills. The goals of the course curriculum innovation are to raise the awareness of data science, promote retention, increase the interest and curiosity, and boost essential data skills for all students on campus. These goals are similar to existing efforts on the design of introductory data science courses for majors and non-majors. The distinctiveness of this course curriculum resides in hands-on learning by examples, case studies, and team-based projects within a low-stakes format, where students from different disciplines early in their college careers collaborated to ethically solve problems in the repetition of data science life cycles. The Innovative Practice Category Work in Progress paper presents our experience in integrating introductory data science into a college-wide computer and information literacy course via collaborative practices of exemplar and project-based learning. The collaborative learning with wide interdisciplinary focus enriched our pedagogues and scalability. Its effectiveness has been measured in a poster session and student perceptions on 5-point Likert scales. Furthermore, integrating introductory data science into a computer and information literacy course served to optimize existing educational resources and facilitate multiple pathways in college. The methodology and studio-like training shown in the experience report can be expanded to upper-level data science courses.";

bibo:abstract "Engineers are a global commodity, who serve to advance the betterment of mankind. Electromagnetics (EM) engineers especially will play an increasingly crucial role in making solar energy economical, advancing health informatics, and preventing nuclear terror, among other roles in the near future. In this day and age, many disciplines are closely intertwined. Traditionally, electromagnetics has played an important role in the curriculum of electrical and/or electronic (EE) engineering. In this paper, electromagnetics is proposed to be introduced as an appetizer course for CS (computer science) and IT (information technology) undergraduates. Since the majority of these students will not pursue a career specializing in electromagnetics, a different approach should be taken to the designing and conducting of this electromagnetics appetizer course that differs from the traditional EE curriculum, which covers topics such as vectors, statics, transmission lines, and waves. On the contrary, this appetizer course should revolve around topics that are relevant to modern life, such as the received signal strength indicated on the smart phone, to which students can relate. The rest of this paper presents an electromagnetics appetizer course introduced at the Department of Computer Science and Networked System, Sunway University, Malaysia, the curriculum of which was validated by Lancaster University, UK.";

Over the years, workshops have been held to provide high school teachers the ability to teach high school students computer science, however not much has been done for middle school teachers. Funded by Google, the three day CS Educator Professional Development Workshop for Middle School Teachers at Kean University brought together teachers to learn about key computer science concepts and work with tools that were previously not known to them, such as Scratch, the Makey Makey tool kit, and the Cue robot. The results of this research find that middle school teachers need access to curriculum materials and digital tools in order to successfully teach computer science to their students. Furthermore, more work should be done to get middle school teachers access to materials and lesson plans aimed at teaching middle school students.";

Following the general lines of this idea, the authors implemented a series of laboratory works that are designed to ensure that students would get hands-on experience with electronic circuits. The paper will present how these will introduce basic key concepts, bridge the gap between theory and practice and lay down a solid foundation for hardware courses that follow in the CS curriculum.";

bibo:abstract "This experience report provides insights into the unintended consequences of five states efforts to make computer science education policy changes in an effort to broaden participation in computing (BPC). At the 2019 Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) meeting, several member-states were invited to share about the unintended consequences of computer science education policy reform in their states. Due to the nature of policy making and implementation, marginalized communities including students, practitioners, and under resourced schools are most impacted by education policy reform efforts. As computer science education gains traction as an education policy priority in states and districts, it is important to learn the lessons of past education policy failures and successes, specifically how these policies could trigger unintended consequences that will impact the broadening of participation within K-12 computer science education. The examples put forth by the states include unintended consequences of policies such as making CS count as a graduation requirement, defining computer science, developing CS standards, and teacher certification. These experienced unintended consequences may be relevant to other states seeking to make CS policy changes. This paper concludes with a reflection on the ECEP model as a tool for mitigating these unintended consequences as part of the BPC efforts.";

bibo:abstract "A recent study conducted at the University of Oklahoma, a large research university attempted to use the grades on initial Computer Science courses to predict the success of Computer Science majors. We attempted to reproduce this study in a mid-sized liberal arts institution. We analyzed 15 years of data of students (majors as well as non-Computer Science majors) who had taken introductory Computer Science courses. We found that the better the grade on Computer Science I, the introductory course in the major, the better the cumulative GPA of the student upon graduation, and this applied to Computer Science majors as well as non-majors. All the students who had successfully graduated with a Computer Science degree had earned at least a C grade in the first three required courses: Computer Science I, Computer Science II and Data Structures. When we considered grades on six of the required courses in the Computer Science sequence, we found that students generally earned the same or lower grade on each subsequent course. Therefore, the performance of Computer Science majors on the first three courses in the required course sequence can reasonably be used as predictors of their success in the major. Finally, we found that Math SAT score was a good predictor of student success in Computer Science I as well as obtaining an undergraduate degree regardless of the major. Our study generalizes the results of the previous study and strengthens the results by finding that they are statistically significant.";

bibo:abstract "Computer Science Unplugged is a collection of free learning activities that teach Computer Science through engaging games and puzzles that use cards, string, crayons and lots of running around. This paper concerns the use of games and relatively simple materials to educate young students about computer science fundamentals. It is devoted to the visualization of abstract concepts of the main principles of the computer science through experiential teaching. The activities introduce students to underlying concepts from the distractions and technical details we usually see with computers. We prepare an introduction of how the data are going through the monitor, computer and converter to the Internet. We assume that we need to secure, efficiently organize, search and sort data. The main purpose of this study is to describe a set of learning activities that were found suitable for non-formal learning environments, result of the project granted by national project KomPrax (Competencies for Practice). The main goal was to motivate students actively create a self-knowledge and prepare the informal activities for teaching computer science. The realization of project showed us experiential teaching is an issue that could change the view on the not very popular parts of computer science. All used learning activities could be implemented within the environment of formal institutions such as secondary schools. The quality of suggested learning activities from the methodical point of view is discussed.";

bibo:abstract "In this study, we trialed the combination of a flipped learning portfolio management system and an interactive assessment platform in a first-year Introduction to computers course (n = 58) to improve students engagement and learning achievements. It was recognized that a well-structured flipped learning model to help the students engage in this novel learning model needed to be developed. Including the potential benefits of the before-class learning tasks via using the flipped learning portfolio management system, and the in-class learning activities via the interactive assessment platform. In order to arrange sufficient time to fully engage with the two-stage learning system and in-class activities, traditional lectures were revised and the classroom format was flipped. After analyzing the students learning portfolio for six weeks, it was found that students need at least three weeks to cultivate the habit of watching videos in the before-class stage. Moreover, the students who watched videos more often showed better learning achievements in the formative and summative assessments. The findings further indicated that 80% of the students liked the videos developed by the teacher rather than those on the Internet. The students also showed positive attitudes toward the flipped learning model integrating those technologies.";

bibo:abstract "Creativity, innovation and leadership are among the essential attributes of future engineers as identified in the Engineer 2020 report by the National Academy of Engineering. It is critical for students to have the ability to identify new needs and opportunities for technological innovation in highly complex and interdisciplinary domains. Historically, entrepreneurship has fueled innovation and the advent of many technological advances. Therefore, education in entrepreneurship for engineering or computing disciplines that complement strong analytical and technical skills, is likely to significantly enhance students' lifelong ability and desire to innovate. The goal of this panel is to discuss a number of education models in entrepreneurship, innovation, and leadership at different types of computing and engineering schools across the country and internationally, in order to identify common themes and effective components for such programs.";

bibo:abstract "Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a very popular game played by two participants on the grid of 3 by 3. A special symbol (X or O) is assigned to each participant to indicate that the slot is covered by the respective participant. The winner of the game is the participant who first cover a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of the board having only their symbols. This paper proposed a winning strategy of Tic-Tac-Toe game and its computation is proved theoretically by the concepts of Theoretical Computer Science using multi-tape turing machine. This algorithm is designed for computer as a player in which computer act according to the intelligence of model to maximize the chances of success. The human player can makes its own choices. Any of the player can play first by their choice. The computation rules ensures selection of best slot for computer that will lead to win or prevent opponent to make a winning move. This is extended work of the paper “The Winner Decision Model of Tic-Tac-Toe Game by using Multi-Tape Turing Machine”. The contribution of this work is to design a strategy to play Tic-Tac-Toe game in which computer will never lose.";

bibo:abstract "If an engineer obtains correct conclusions, but cannot communicate these results in a proper way, then the value of the achievements could be diminishing dramatically. Awareness about the importance of acquiring soft skills in addition to technical knowledge is often present in engineering education, but the issue is still how the improvement of these key competencies should be addressed. Often our engineering classes are heterogeneous, both with respect to pre-knowledge of the mathematical and technical skills, but also concerning the cultural background of the students. This can be an additional challenge for the teaching situation. Instead of considering the cultural heterogeneity as an obstacle, we decided to use it as an advantage for enhancing soft skills in a mathematics course. In this paper, we describe a multicultural-based teaching approach for improving soft skills in engineering and computer science education.";

bibo:abstract "This Research Work in Progress paper presents a study on how teaching assistants (TAs) in introductory computer science courses experience their roles and responsibilities in programming lab sessions. Eight semi-structured interviews were performed with TAs who worked in different introductory computer science courses at a technical university in Sweden. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Four main themes were identified: uncertainty with assessing, lack of training and instructions, communication and students in focus. The most important finding is that TAs, even those with long experience of teaching, experienced uncertainties with the assessment of the assignments. Typically, the guidelines given to the TAs only included the functionalities of the program, but the TAs express that they also assessed whether the students understood the concepts and how their code worked. Noteworthily, the TAs had been offered none or little formal training and instead relied on informal mentorships and own experiences. Furthermore, the course structure and communication channels were also described as areas that could be improved. The TAs did, however, try to assist all their students, and tutor and support them from the best of their abilities.";

A variety of AI assistants have recently been released, and among the most popular is OpenAI's ChatGPT. In this work-in-progress in innovative practice, we explore evidence-based learning strategies and the integration of Generative AI for computer science and engineering education. We expect this research will lead to innovative pedagogical approaches to enhance undergraduate computer science and engineering education. In particular, we describe how ChatGPT was used in two computing-based courses: a Junior-level course in database systems and a Senior-level class in mobile application development. We identify four evidence-based learning strategies: well-defined learning goals, authentic learning experiences, structured learning progression, and strategic assessment. We align these strategies with the two aforementioned courses and evaluate the usefulness of ChatGPT specifically in achieving the learning goals. Combining Generative AI with evidence-based learning has the potential to transform modern education into a more personalized learning experience.";

bibo:abstract "The era of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) allows people to learn without any limits “anywhere and anytime”. Mobile learning is considered as new and interesting form of learning due to the high spread and development of mobile technologies. In E-learning, the educational content is delivered through electronic technologies such as internet (mobility of learning content). Whereas, in M-learning, the mobility covers learning content, learners, and learning process. So, The M -learning is known as learning using mobile devices: smartphones, tablet computer ... etc. However, the mobile learning systems have some challenges or difficulties in term of the design, development and the technology usability. In this paper we develop a mobile system that enhances the learning process of the students of computer science. Moreover, our system provides several adaptation strategies to meet the needs of heterogeneous learners. The results of the tested system (on a group of second year license students) show the improvement in learning achievement of students and the big influence of our Mobile learning system on the degree of understanding of the courses";

bibo:abstract "This paper tries to motivate the audience using an interactive and entertaining environment due to the difficult tedious issues existing in the learning of computer science causing the loss of motivation in them. The more the educational environment becomes interesting and attractive, the more the students engage in the educational challenge. The traditional environment was not attractive enough, which creates a boring environment having no motivation for learning. We aim to teach computer science to the students and the audiences in a way different from the traditional ones with the advancement of Game-based learning. In this regard, we not only aim to teach the students, but also to motivate them to learn in an entertaining, challenging and engaging environment by creating a serious educational game. We can teach using serious game and fully monitor the learner's way of learning using the management environment created by the game as well. For example, at which level the learning progress is achieved, or at which level the difficulty of the game was problematic for the student. We can have a full control over the students' learning with regard to the feedbacks, and re-design the stages or the teaching method if necessary. In this method, we can fully monitor the students and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. This was too difficult to do in the previous traditional environments requiring a lot of time to spend on interacting with each student. We used serious educational game as a new educational method in computer science to evaluate the effect of education on the students. We have selected some volunteers studying this major to fill out a survey in order to compare the effect of education they experienced after playing the game using game-based learning as well as the effect of previous educational environments such as class room learning, traditional eLearning and hands-on learning.";

This paper presents an exploratory study of the learning objects designed to support computer science teaching and learning. The aim of the exploratory study is to get insight into the characteristics of computer science learning objects and to study different factors related to them. These factors include growth over time, user ratings, and personal collections. The learning objects were retrieved from The Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT), a leading learning object repository which contains many learning objects under different disciplines. The study concludes by giving recommendations on improving the quality of computer science learning objects.";

bibo:abstract "Recent years have seen much debate about the appropriate content of software engineering (SE) programs and how they relate to computer science (CS) programs, culminating in the distinguishing knowledge areas identified in the ACM/IEEE CS and SE curricula. Given these publications, a reasonable question to ask is: how do current SE programs differ from CS programs and to what extent do the differences reflect the characterizing features given in the ACM/IEEE curricula? We aim to answer these questions for SE programs offered in England. The content of a third of the SE programs in England are analyzed and summarized with respect to the knowledge areas of both the ACM/IEEE CS and SE curricula. The results reveal interesting features; such as intelligent systems is a more distinguishing feature between the CS and SE programs than the expected knowledge areas given in the SE curriculum. The main finding is that there are relatively few differences between existing SE and CS programs offered in England. We conclude with a discussion of the reasons for this situation and its likely implications.";

For instance, they cover social-media platforms (e.g., Twitter, YouTube) to elicit how individuals outside of the scientific community interact with publications. Still, it is somewhat unclear to what extent Altmetrics are a valuable addition to existing metrics, or may represent only proxies without additional value. In this paper, we present our current steps towards understanding this problem in more detail. To this end, we describe and discuss the results of an initial correlation study that revealed significant positive correlations of different strengths between four categories of Altmetrics and citations. We elaborate on potential causes for, and the impact of, these correlations to define steps for future research aimed at understanding the value of Altrnetrics.";

bibo:abstract "The prediction of student academic performance has drawn noticeable attention in higher education institutions. It may help educational institutions in providing quick assistance to students who are low performed at an early stage. However, it becomes challenging to predict the performance of students because the numerous amount and complexity of the variables such as student's demographics information, student's achievement data, and student's activity data. The purposes of this study are to develop a predictive model using Logistic Regression algorithm on student data coming from a computer science faculty in an Indonesian private university and to identify variables in playing a part in student's performance. The dataset is gathered from the past decade's student records: 2010–2020. It is then explored and preprocessed using various approaches such as merging, aggregating, feature encoding, and SMOTE. About 75% of the dataset is used for training and the remaining is for the testing set. Out of 20 variables used, 10 variables are statistically significant to the response variable. The results show that Logistic Regression achieves a considerably good predictive model with an accuracy rate of 91%, recall rate of 98%, and precision rate of 85%. The model can be used as an early warning system to identify low-performing students and inform both the faculty members and the students. Faculty members can then employ a range of strategies to communicate with low-performing students and give them with opportunities to improve their performance.";

The prior self-confidence of female students in Computer Science may be improving with increasing enrollment. Whenever there was a statistically significant difference among racial groups, positively stereotyped racial groups were better prepared and had higher prior self-confidence than the traditionally under-represented racial groups. Whenever there was a statistically significant difference between the sexes in the assessment of the tutor, female students assessed the tutor more favorably than male students. When there was a statistically significant difference between racial groups, under-represented racial groups assessed the tutor more favorably than positively stereotyped racial groups.

bibo:abstract "The student projects done in Computer Science and Engineering suffers from the following problems: poorly managed requirements, poor or no design and poor or no testing. Students generally tend to focus more on coding phase of the project, since the misconception is that a large code constitutes good software. Unlike other branches of engineering, the engineering processes are not visible here. Further, management of large number of student projects poses a challenge in terms of guidance, progress monitoring and assessment. The student projects are observed to be ending up incomplete and are rarely deployed. The feedback from industry side also speaks about the gaps in terms of these skills. A mini project course for fifth semester is designed in the undergraduate programme in Computer Science and Engineering to address the lacunae observed above by tightly integrating it with the theory course on Software engineering. The focus of the mini project is not on what the problem definition is, instead it is on how it is done. The implementation plan addressed the issues and challenges listed above faced by the faculty. Assessment rubrics are written to guarantee proper understanding of the expectations among the stake holders resulting in fair assessment. This approach improved students understandability in Software engineering concepts and also the quality of their capstone projects. The paper discusses the design, implementation and assessment details of mini project along with the experience gained.";

bibo:abstract "This paper proposes the use of metaverse for computer science education by leveraging virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. VR glasses are used to record videos such as presentation slides and classroom lectures in the metaverse. AI technologies automatically generate customized class notes summarized from the video recordings. This education metaverse can accommodate students' digital avatars in different virtual workspaces, including collaboration spaces, laboratories, and classrooms. It consists of practical features that mimic a physical classroom setup, such as real-time voice chat, avatar movement, and shared screen presentations. In the metaverse journey, the AI notes generator module is used to create personalized class notes using technologies including optical character recognition, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech. We discuss current progress and future work to prototype an AI-assisted metaverse for proof-of-concept experiments in computer science education.";

bibo:abstract "The flipped classroom is the new educational model in using technology to impact and enhanced education. From the published research on Flipped classroom concluded that has not been rigorously evaluated as a pedagogy but case studies are emerging. This research study focused on analyzing possibilities of flipped classroom in Computer Sciences particularly focusing on its implementation in 3 (three) courses: Programming. Object Oriented Programming and software engineering. Measured are Motivation of lecturer and motivation of student, increased attendance, better grades, access to learning materials, learning at own peace, better understanding, higher-level cognitive skills. Also flipped classroom impact on the learning outcomes has been investigated: Knowledge and understanding, Applying knowledge and understanding, Making judgment, Communications skills. Four broad categories of instructional approaches for use in an flipped classroom have been identified: (a) individual activities, (b) paired activities, (c) informal small groups, and (d) cooperative student projects. The research study is based on the theory of Bloom's revised taxonomy of cognitive domain. In order to analyze this, a case study experiment was realized and insights as well as recommendations are presented.";

The advances in engineering and the lowered hardware cost made acquiring and building a robot an easier task for a person to get started in robotic education. That lower cost also made it possible for many organizations across the world to hold educational programs and camps to educate young students in programming and robotics. In this paper we show a case study on how robotic programming camps for teens helped shape their ideas in the computer science field and engage students in programming interest.";

We found that female students had taken fewer CS courses prior to BJC but that students from URMs had taken more prior CS courses. Both groups were nearly equally likely to recommend the course to a friend, with about 80% recommending. We found no evidence to suggest that female students showed more or less interest in specific CS topics, such as learning how computing has changed the world or making mobile apps/games. Despite having taken more CS courses prior to BJC, we found that students from URMs were overall less likely to intend to take additional CS courses. Overall, our findings are fairly consistent with the literature, and suggest that BJC makes some progress towards broadening participation in computing.";

bibo:abstract "For all computer scientists the term `modeling' is well known. It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project “Informatics - A Child's Play”, which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons.";

bibo:abstract "In this paper, we describe a two course sequence that has been taught to majors in computer science and a variety of other disciplines. The first course is called \"Introduction to Computing\"; the second course is \"Introduction to Programming\". The \"Computing\" course is a ten-week course that includes material on the following: the \"computing perspective\" (the algorithmic model as a way of thinking); foundational concepts underlying program design and implementation, including: algorithmic methods, static and dynamic data structures, and design using abstraction; fundamental notions of algorithm analysis and computability; and use of application tools such as e-mail, Web browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, databases, and equation solvers. Building on this foundational pre-programming material, students in the \"Programming\" course are able to learn rapidly the skills in program design, implementation, and debugging necessary to solve computational problems in a high-level programming language. We emphasize effective use of abstraction and the acquisition of software development skills that are language independent. Our experience with these courses has convinced us that it is possible to introduce the conceptual foundations of computer science to beginning students in a way that both engages them and gives them a basis for learning advanced ways to solve problems using computing, either via programming or through use of modern, highly-programmable commercial applications.";

bibo:abstract "The origins of computer forensic science are examined and correlated to the evolution of forensic technologies and future research and development. Techniques to recover information from attempts to destroy files or inflict physical damage to the computer are illustrated. Included is a discussion on the specialized environments, tools and techniques required to recover information from physically damaged disks. Magnetic techniques to retrieve data that has been physically overwritten are also reviewed. The physical characteristics of the disks are examined to recover altered data. The influence of magnetic fields on the behavior of domains in the fringe areas are studied to determine previously recorded information. The direction, properties, position and size of the domains are correlated to determine bit values. \"State file analysis\" is introduced to ascertain the order in which electronic events and hence overall computer events have occurred. Sequences of events can therefore be reconstructed in cases where dates and times are altered or erased. Legal issues for the forensic scientist are as equally important in the recovery process. The significance in procedure and preparation for the courts is addressed describing concerns for both prosecution and defence. Trends in both past and current development are analyzed and correlated to future technologies.";

bibo:abstract "With the growth of technology and the changing of human behavior, the fields of Computer Science (CS), Information Technology (IT), and Data Science (DS) become more popular and should be learned by children, students, and people. Consequently, institutes widely initiate new online/offline courses to serve this need. However, this leads to educate different knowledge and skills in which some of them may not match the needs of companies for hiring employees. To address this issue, we introduce a new system for analyzing content on CS courses, called CSCDA system (Computer Science Course Description Analysis system). The system can identify similar and dissimilar contents belonging to two CS courses by applying text processing techniques and keyword similarity matching. These identified contents can help to set up a standard, to improve integrity and quality, and to reduce redundancy of the contents will be taught in the courses. Experimental studies are conducted on CS courses of Thai Universities to investigate the effectiveness of the CSCDA system based on four measures, i.e. percentage of similar contents, precision, recall, and F-measure, respectively. Last, a comparative study is performed and the result shows that our proposed method can effectively analyze course contents and outperforms the other keyword extraction methods.";

There are many curriculum resources, especially in China, but most of them are relatively independent and cannot guide students to acquire more knowledge which is relevant to this course directly. To relieve these issues, in this paper, we propose an ontology system for the computer course architecture (OSCCA) to instruct, guide, and direct students efficient learning. OSCCA collects undergraduate course catalogs from the twenty famous Chinese universities and some network education websites. Then course entities and their interrelationships are culled to build Chinese course ontology. Based on these roles, OSCCA can provide effectively and contributed learning guidance to the fresh learner and OSCCA is developed by Java.";

bibo:abstract "The COVID-19 pandemic caused many universities to switch from on-campus education to distance education, in just a couple of days. In this study, we investigate how computer science (CS) majors experienced the emergency remote education during the first months of the pandemic. We sent out a survey to bachelor's and master's students, which yielded 794 responses. In the survey, we asked the students to compare the online education to their on-campus education on a number of aspects, such as motivation, experienced stress and the possibility to collaborate with other students. We also asked the students to compare the quality of learning activities, such as lectures and tutorials. The results show that students preferred the on-campus setting in all aspects, but on open-ended questions about advantages, the students stated the new education format made their schedule more flexible, increased accessibility of learning material, and reduced commuting time. We also identified some differences between the students' year of study, implying that different courses did not adapt to the new conditions equally well.";

bibo:abstract "The traditionally taught face-to-face course in statistics for undergraduate non-statistics students suffered from several problems: Time and location constraints, different preknowledge in mathematics, lack of motivation, no use of statistical software etc. Therefore, we decided to develop an e-learning course in statistics to reduce the impact of these problems. This paper describes the different components developed for the e-learning course as well as the teaching framework. Preliminary results from the first in-class usage of the e-learning course indicate positive qualitative effects. In addition, we discuss which of the e-learning components the students mainly preferred to use. Furthermore, we show that the exam results from the e-learning course are significantly better than the corresponding results from the face-to-face course in this first in-class usage.";

bibo:abstract "This study, strives to understand the low retention and facilitate mechanisms to encourage the retention of women in the department of computer science at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. Two interventions attempt to address the concern for the reason why women quit CS field-one, women are more inclined to solve real world problems either in the scientific or social field that can benefit humanity; and two, women are dependent on social networking and more inclined to share their feelings with others when compared to men. We verified both hypotheses by creating a Facebook discussion group among consented students in the introductory courses and replacing the traditional assignments with the ones that are designed closer to real-life problem in Fall 2015. By the end of the semester, we surveyed our participants to examine the effect of the two interventions. According to the results we got from our research, we can conclude that both building the online discussion platform and using more practical examples will help increase women's interest in studying computer science. A feedback mechanism was developed to help us continue our research in the future following these interventions, and improve our approach by the implementing the feedback.";

So the dropout rate is getting high day by day in these subjects. Especially developing countries like Bangladesh. In this work, we have used current computer science students' data to predict their and also prospective C.S. students' future performance and the chance of dropout using machine learning algorithms like SVM, naïve Bayes, neural network, etc. We have also predicted the crucial factors that are strongly correlated to the performance of a C.S. student.";

This paper reports on the process of developing a task-based English-as-a-Foreign-Language curriculum in a Japanese computer science university. 38 tasks, which language education experts perceived as important, were re-evaluated by computer science experts via an online needs analysis survey with the goal of selecting target tasks for first- and second-year English courses. The results indicate that there are both similarities and discrepancies in the perception of task importance between English and computer science faculty members. A qualitative analysis of comments from computer science professors illuminates the logic behind their judgements about the needs of teaching particular tasks. The cooperation between language and content experts is indispensable in the development of the curriculum of English for science and technology; it allows for synthesis of a variety of viewpoints and development of a stronger English curriculum.";

During our research, we found that there is no free gender forecasting tool to predict an arbitrary number of names. We addressed this shortcoming by providing a tool that can predict an arbitrary number of names with free requests. We demonstrate our tool through a number of experimental results. We show that this tool is better than other gender prediction tools of names for analysing social problems with big data. In our approach, lists of data can be dynamically processed and the results of the data can be displayed with a dynamic graph. We present experiments of using this tool to analyse the gender disparity in computer science in the UK, Malaysia and China.";

We integrated CT with existing curriculum alongside programming and teaching general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or languages at the beginning. Our aim here is not only to teach a programming language per se, but also to teach, at the beginning, the different ways of problem solving, logical reasoning, algorithm design, and programming constructs with minimal or no emphasis on syntax. A positive learning experience is successfully developed for our students by using appropriate pedagogies and strategies. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey as well as a pre- and post-CT test were conducted on student cohort in different sections. The statistical analysis of the survey and test results show evidence of improvement in student's problem solving and coding skills as well as increase in motivation towards programming.";

Accomplishment of this goal is often severely hampered by the fact that many computer science faculty view the software process as intellectually shallow and that many computer science students come to the field with an aversion to the oppressive discipline which they perceive to be required to follow it. We have devised a method of forcing students to recognize the necessity of software engineering best practice by bringing them to the realization that without it they will fail, not in their course work, but in real-world software development projects. The method has been tested twice at Stevens Institute and is about to be used at a number of other universities. Evaluation of results is being done through the use of two standard instruments, the Felder Learning Styles Inventory and the Academic Locus of Control Scale and of a novel Attitude Toward Software Engineering (ATSE) instrument designed by the authors.";

bibo:abstract "Traditional engineering methods are considered unsuitable for the development of usable and engaging interactive systems such as online experimentation and simulation software. For systems involving users, user-centric design approaches are more appropriate. The ideation stage of design involves exploring the space of opportunities. One commonly held view in design disciplines is that quantity leads to quality. Yet, for related non-design disciplines such as engineering, quantity is often regarded as a negative characteristic associated with low quality. Focusing on quality alone may lead to inferior user experience and ineffective systems. This study describes an initiative to (1) collect empirical evidence to support the design-belief that quantity leads to quality and (2) to use the activity and its results as part of a pedagogical strategy to enhance students' awareness of the connections between quantity and quality during ideation. A class of 100 computer science students was divided into two groups. Both groups were given the same task to design a text-input strategy for individuals with motor disabilities but with different focuses: one group was asked to focus on quality of ideas and the other group on the quantity of ideas. The results show that the students who focused on quantity of ideas produced better quality concepts compared to the students that focused on quality. The results were presented to and discussed with the students as a part of the learning process.";

bibo:abstract "This paper describes the design and implementation of a radiation tolerant on-board computer (OBC) for the science and technology satellite-3 (STSAT-3). SRAM-based FPGAs are replacing traditional integrated circuits for space applications. However, it is difficult to employ the approach in space applications without radiation tolerant schemes to deal with the radiation effects such as single event upset (SEU). To mitigate the SEU effect, we apply a triple modular redundancy (TMR) scheme to the STSAT-3 OBC based on FPGA. Although there is an overhead in area, power and minimum clock period, we notice through a radiation test in an irradiation facility that our TMR based OBC is immune to the radiation environments up to a proton energy of 20.3MeV. The radiation environment of the test is expected to be more severe than the environment in which STSAT-3 is to be located.";

bibo:abstract "The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic subtitle generation system for computer science lecture videos. CMU Sphinx Speech API is used to accomplish speech recognition. The main challenge of this work, is to align the translated text with the video. Discourse Segment Detection (DSD) is the process of analyzing and identifying discourse boundaries in human speech. Discourse Segment Detection (DSD) is carried out that classifies word boundaries and groups words until a discourse break occurs. The approach that has been devised in this paper for DSD to identify word boundary is a hybrid approach combining acoustic and linguistic features from the speech. This helps to segment the text obtained from Speech Engine, group words that can be written to the subtitles file without violating the subtitle standards. The devised approach has shown an improved performance than the existing approach as the error has reduced from 30% to 18 %.";

bibo:abstract "The first Bachelor of Science in computer science program was offered by our department 25 years ago. Today, as a School of Information Technology, we offer six computer science undergraduate degree programs, two graduate degree programs, and one doctoral degree program. In this paper, we report how our existing undergraduate degree programs have been revised using the six sigma DMAIC methodology to guarantee the continuous quality improvement of the programs and the quality of the graduates. We report on how two new unique undergraduate degree programs (B.Sc. in Computer and Cyber Security and B.Sc. in Office Computer Technology) were created by applying the DFSS six sigma concept. This not only guarantees the quality of the program and our graduates, but also ensures that we can meet the future demands of employers. We also report DFSS results on our two unique graduate programs: the M.Sc. in Computer Education Technology, a multi-disciplinary program combining computing, learning psychology, education, computer business, and ethics, and the M.Sc. in Information Technology Strategy which has derived from a combination of information technology, management, ethics, and strategies. Our doctoral program called Quality Information Technology, opened in 2005, is also briefly reported as our newest curriculum resulting from our six sigma-based research and development project.";

The purpose of this paper was to present the design, development, and evaluation of CS Challenger. CS Challenger is a mobile application which was developed to motivate students through interactive gaming techniques to facilitate rewards and rankings. For the first time in the Namibian context, a contextualised mobile app was developed to gamify the concepts of five modules offered to Computer Science students at UNAM. The results from the evaluation suggest that CS Challenger provides a motivating environment in which students can quickly grasp the concept of a subject. The findings of the study are expected to inform managers in education in Namibia on alternative means of providing gamified learning content to students.";

bibo:abstract "We are experiencing a technology shift: powerful and easy-to-use touchscreen-based mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are becoming more prevalent than traditional PCs and laptops. Many mobile devices are going to be the first and, in less developed countries, possibly the only computing devices that virtually all people would own and carry with them at all times. We propose to reflect this new reality in how computer science is taught in the classroom. In this tutorial, participants will learn about developing software directly on smartphones without a PC using TouchDevelop on Windows Phone, a novel application-creation environment from Microsoft Research. Its typed, structured programming language is built around the idea of using only a touchscreen as the input device to author code. Easy access to the rich sensor and personal data available on a mobile device results in a fun and engaging programming experience for students.";

bibo:abstract "In today's technological market, job candidates must possess technical and communication skills to acquire a desired position. Computer science programs, for the most part, provide the technological training, but are inconsistent in teaching students all the necessary communication skills. In many computer science curricula faculty members realizing the importance of improving writing ability have incorporated writing intensive courses. However, many computer science curricula neglect oral communication, largely because of the amount of class time needed to make presentations. Several gaps exist between computer science curricula and business world reality. Computer science curricula must teach students to listen and express themselves clearly, since getting the maximum utilization of an information resource requires contact with the user community. This is not to say that educators have ignored industry requests. The emerging trend in computer science curricula is to stress written and oral communication skills. This article discusses the importance of incorporating speaking intensive courses into computer science programs. In addition, this article reviews two courses that have included speeches and presentations. Finally it presents a new way to grade oral communication.";

bibo:abstract "This paper describes an innovative approach to develop the understanding about the relevance of mathematics to computer science. The mathematical subjects are introduced through an application-to-model scheme that lead computer science students to a better understanding of why they have to learn math and learn it effectively. The authors' approach consists of a single one semester course, taught at the first semester of the program, where the students are initially exposed to some typical computer applications. When they recognize the applications' complexity, the instructor gives the mathematical models supporting such applications, even before a formal introduction to the model in a math course. They applied this approach at Unesp (Brazil) and the results include a large reduction in the rate of students that abandon the college and better students in the final years of the program.";

bibo:abstract "As the discipline of computer science grew, undergraduate computer science education continued to change and, has for the most part, kept pace with the new topics in the field. However, the pedagogy had not changed significantly. Although the curriculum at the University of Virginia was comparable to that of most other universities, it had neither the rigor nor the practical experience needed to prepare undergraduates for the workplace or meaningful graduate study. Thus, we believed a major shift of emphasis away from the traditional computer science curriculum was needed. We believe that: a more engineering orientation must be incorporated into all of our core courses; students need a more extensive grounding in software engineering; all courses must increase the degree of mathematical rigor; students need hands-on experiences with appropriate, current artifacts, as well as intense laboratory experiences which will help students develop inter-personal and engineering skills in addition to course content; and providing real-world \"practice\" is important and needs to be a fundamental element of the complete curriculum. We have incorporated these concepts into our new CS curriculum. We have offered the new CS1 course for 10 semesters with good results; we have also developed and offered three follow-on courses. The student and faculty responses have been very favorable. They are excited by the new courses and the closed laboratory component. All of these courses have lecture slides, laboratory activities, homework assignments, etc. available on the web for public viewing.";

This literature survey maps to searching the web for published papers in different professional society like ACM, IEEE and by any related digital library of their domain of interest. These Professional Societies have knowledge base regarding research publication. The knowledge base uses ontology build by ontology expert of that domain, publically available to reuse. These ontologies suffer from the limitations of domain knowledge. We have proposed a novel scheme to map among different types of ontology build by different professional society using Metadata of research publication. To map ontology we use DDC (Dewey Decimal Code), a classification system, to fit different domain ontologies into one based on the metadata. The metadata play vital role to make ontology, which are obtained from research publications, has attributes Subject, Title, keyword, Author Name, and Affiliation etc. This Integrated ontology is generalization of world knowledge.";

Due to the wide scope of the subject and the constraint of one course only, this introductory course remains one of the hardest courses to teach, and leads to the possibility of a variety of possible goals for such a course.

bibo:abstract "On-line selling website is currently famous and popular. There are several websites selling products and/or services including on-line book-selling websites. At present, the current book-selling websites usually apply recommender systems to recommend a book or a set of books to customers. However, the recommender systems mostly focus on recommending books that users usually view or buy together and also on books having high review rates. This may cause failure to recommend books that cover most required contents, for example, books related to a course description of a course students have registered. To address on this issue, we here introduce an alternative recommender system called Supplementary Books Suggestion system (SBS system) to create a list of supplementary books related/relevance to a course description of a course in computer science domain by regarding relevance between a book and a course description. This can help students easily find supplementary books to read and also may help to encourage the students doing self-learning. Experiments on real course descriptions were conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the SBS system in the terms of precision, recall, F-measure and average (also total) coverage/uncoverage of contents between a list of supplementary books and a course description.";

bibo:abstract "This case study is about the introduction of computer science to girls in an all-girl environment. Due to the lack of women in technology, many efforts are being made to expose girls to computer programming at an early age. Code camp organizers are using the all-girl model to help put participants more at ease and boost their computing confidence. High computer self-efficacy leads to studying computer science, while the stereotypical views of coding as a male subject and lack of ability in girls hinder women from pursuing CS degrees. For this study, a local Northern Virginia University offered two Java programming summer code camps in the summer of 2016, one course as an all-girl class and the other as a co-ed environment. A total of 19 girls participated and submitted post-workshop survey responses. In this paper, we explore the questionnaire differences in response between the girls within the two groups. The implications of introducing computer science to girls in a single-sex setting and its effect on girls' view of CS and computer self-efficacy is also discussed.";

bibo:abstract "Many of us know the important work of Karl Popper, as philosopher of Science, specialized in modeling and simulation. Karl Popper is generally regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of Science of the 20th century. Among the criteria of the scientific method, which are intangible principles, we find refutability, non-contradiction and reproducibility. The latter is one of the conditions on which Popper distinguishes between the scientific or pseudo-scientific character of a study. Indeed, Science works by drawing “laws” or “principles” from reproducible observations whose main property is to be true as long as no observation has proved otherwise. Scientific conclusions can only be drawn from a well observed and described “result/event”, which has appeared several times, and has been observed by different people and/or studies. This criterion eliminates what seriously distorts the results as well as errors in judgment or even manipulations by scientists.";

bibo:abstract "In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensor nodes eventually die due to battery depletion. WSNs in which new nodes are periodically redeployed with certain intervals, called generations, to replace the dead nodes are called multi-phase WSNs. In the literature, there are several key predistribution schemes proposed for secure operation of WSNs. However, these schemes are designed for single-phase networks which are not resilient against continuous node capture attacks; even under temporary attacks on the network, the harm caused by the attacker does not heal in time. However, the periodic deployments in multi-phase sensor networks could be utilized to improve the resiliency of the WSNs by deploying nodes with fresh keys. In the literature, there is limited work done in this area. In this paper, we propose a key predistribution scheme for multi-phase WSNs which is resilient under node capture attacks. In our scheme, called random generation material (RGM) key predistribution scheme, each generation of deployment has its own random keying material and pairwise keys are established between node pairs of particular generations. These keys are specific to these generations. Therefore, a captured node cannot be abused to obtain keys of other generations. We compare the performance of our RGM scheme with a well-known multi-phase key predistribution scheme and show that RGM achieves up to 3-fold more resiliency. Even under heavy attacks, our scheme's resiliency performance is 35 % better in steady state.";

bibo:abstract "In this Work in Progress Innovative Practice paper, we describe a process for finding predictors for student success - and failure - for Computer Science and Computer Engineering students with a focus on the second programming course (CS2). We use readily available off-the-shelf statistical and data mining tools for generating summary statistics, calculating correlations, testing statistical significance, and creating decision trees. We analyze grade data from the first programming course (CS1), entry-level STEM courses (Calculus and Physics), and an English course to determine success predictors for CS2. Not surprisingly, the grade in CS1 is the best predictor for success in CS2. We also find that success in CS2 is independent of gender. Looking deeper into the data, we find characteristics of students who are very likely to pass or fail CS2. Being able to identify predictors for success is useful for calibrating admission criteria and designing appropriate interventions (e.g., requiring prereq classes, recitation sessions, and so on) to improve success probability for all students. A key contribution of this paper is a step-by-step process that can be used by other programs to find success predictors and design appropriate interventions.";

However, these courses often fail the real-world test by one important factor: they are not interdisciplinary projects, which is not indicative of industry experiences. We are attempting to create an interdisciplinary environment for capstone courses, involving both design and computer science students, to more adequately prepare students for industry work. This work-in-progress paper describes our experiences and plans for bettering the interdisciplinary capstone experience. The experiences show that there is a fundamental miscommunication between students of different disciplines that hinders their ability to collaborate. By analyzing qualitative questionnaires from thirty-three computer science students, we have affirmed the existence of this rift in inter-departmental understanding. This realization has formed our basis for creating educational modules to ease the collaboration between computer science and design students.";

The Mobile Computer Science Principles (Mobile CSP) project at the College of St. Scholastica, an established curriculum endorsed by the College Board for its alignment with the Advanced Placement (AP) CSP framework, has formed a Research-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) with CE programs at Capital Community College in CT and Southwest Minnesota State University and with partner schools in each state. The RPP explores whether CS through CE can broaden the high school to college pathway in computing disciplines for those traditionally underrepresented in these fields-female, underrepresented minority, and low-SES students. By implementing and studying CS through CE in two contexts (rural and low-SES in Minnesota and urban, diverse, and low-SES in Connecticut), the project contributes to transforming the educational pathways in CS in a variety of contexts and to understanding the supports and barriers to implementing CSP as CE with a broadening-participation goal.";

To address this, our institution has developed an undergraduate course in which students contribute to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects under the guidance of a dedicated mentor. By contributing to FOSS projects, students can: find a mentor or role model; collaborate with, participate in, and contribute to a welcoming and supporting community; and see that they can have real-world positive impact. This paper describes the course and our experiences in teaching it, and provides evidence that it can have a positive impact on diversity by increasing retention and improving students’ confidence.";

bibo:abstract "Over the years, many innovative and successful ideas related to educational research and teaching practice have been reported in engineering journals and conferences and at various conferences within the engineering disciplines. However, finding or creating an environment within one's own institution to apply these ideas is often difficult. A source of this difficulty may be that implementation of such ideas typically requires resources or support that may not be available. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a bottom-up, faculty-driven approach to changing teaching that allows faculty to support each other by the process. Specifically, a rationale is developed for use of peer facilitated reflective teaching practice within education, a particular model, the Reflective Teaching Model (RTM) is introduced and a pilot conducted within a University computer science program is described.";

This work uses the CRISP-DM methodology e data from Cobalto Management System. The results are shown for three algorithms and for the RandomForest algorithm a precision of 95.12% and a Recall of 91.41% is presented indicating that it is possible to use a prediction model using only the data from the first three semesters of the course.";

This paper proposes a model to identify focus research areas of computer science researchers thru their publications. We collect title, abstract and keywords of academic papers published in IEEE Xplore digital library of selected researchers from computer science departments of four universities in Thailand and we use them as our test datasets. In addition, the ACM computational classification system (CCS) is used to build a topic corpus based on the terms gathered from the leaf nodes and we have totally 379 topics in the corpus. For each article, a number of topics are extracted and the probability of each topic is computed using the Labeled LDA approach. For each article, topics in the top 90 percentile are selected as the main representatives. When selected topics of all articles from one author are combined, we compute the average probability of each topic, and choose topics in the top 95 percentile since they would be considered as the focus research areas of the author. Next, we compare the focus areas of all researchers in one university. Obviously, each department has a wide range of focus topics. Finally, we identify the top 10 common focus areas of researchers from all 4 universities.";

However, student success in learning computer science theory is not limited to only those three learning theories.

bibo:abstract "The pandemic context forced most of the Higher Education Institutions, and therefore their faculties, to face a semester of teaching in an online mode. The universities defined general guidelines and strategies to try to guarantee a minimum quality of the process. However, the literature reports that, depending on its particularities, preparing a semester-long online course requires a design of several months. Therefore, each lecturer worked according to her experience, guidelines, and support she received: \"What could be done, was done.\" This article reports the teaching experience of the 1st semester 2020 of the Computer Science undergraduate program at the Universidad Católica de Temuco. Some lecturers of this undergraduate program had previous experience in online training; hence they designed strategies that differed in teaching, evaluation, and interaction methodologies while using several technologies available to them. A sample of 115 of our students answered a questionnaire to assess the preferences and problems during this semester. The results show a heterogeneous set of clusters. However, they point to a constructivist asynchronous vision in a group of our students that prefer short videos uploaded by their professors, and the resources that, by their means, they find on the Internet, point towards a constructivist asynchronous vision in a group of our students. The results also allowed us to rescue good practices that help in proposing an emergency online teaching model that will guide the design of the second-semester courses.";

It is a branch of Computational Linguistics and one of the ultimate goals of the research in Artificial Intelligence. Machine translation is of applicable importance as well as scientific importance. Due to the rapid development of Internet and globalization of economic, machine translation plays an increasingly important role in promoting an open exchange of politics, economy and culture. Therefore, the course of information processing and machine translation has been set up as an elective course for the students of computer science in our university. Around 100 students attend this course each year. The course has demanded considerable investment of time and effort. Introduction is a very important part for a course. It can make the students understand the objectives, tasks, connotation and characteristics of the course. Moreover, the introduction part can provide the students the outline of the course and arouse the students' enthusiasm. This paper introduced the design of the introduction of this course, including subject depending, problem posing, tortuous process, problem of ambiguity, revival of natural language processing, the motive force of modem social progress, perception and cognition, valuable cognitive knowledge, the contribution of natural language processing to knowledge acquisition.";

bibo:abstract "The traditional methods of testing both hardware and software within a product's lifecycle has evolved into various methodologies, some successful and others not so successful. These various strategies have grown in importance and the traditional phases of coding and then testing no longer have definitive boundaries. The traditional scenario of \"design\", code, and then \"toss over the wall\" for testing is no longer applicable. Henry Cogswell College, has responded to this importance of the testing process from industry in information technology with a new course entitled CS 472, Software Testing and Reliability. Prior to the introduction of this specialty course, software testing was covered only in a software engineering course. The goal of this course is to prepare students for software testing management, testing considerations, designing for testing, and exposure to these various methodologies. Various design techniques for product reliability, quality assurance, and applying various testing tools and methodologies are studied and applied in a classroom environment. The end result is to achieve a product that is reliable, effective, and produced at or under budget and also \"on time\". The application of automated test cases and the strengths and weakness of synergistic applications are also explored.";

bibo:abstract "Declining student populations in the computer science field coupled with a growing demand creates the need for higher attraction rates. We examine new techniques for exposing high school students to the computer science field through the use of a Java-based autonomous robotics curriculum. This curriculum, designed by researchers to function as a means for conveying basic concepts during a limited engagement time, raises students with no prior knowledge of computer science to a level of comfort with both basic and advanced concepts within five sessions. Emphasis is placed on object-oriented design, behavior based programming, and autonomous operation of robots. The curriculum, structured into knowledge blocks which build on each other, provides students with clear goals and achievements during each session. Students work extensively with controlling robotic motors, sensors, and output devices through their own programs. Ultimately, students are asked to combine all of their learned knowledge by programming their robot to utilize behavior-based techniques to autonomously navigate a maze. Both quantitative and qualitative results have indicated significant knowledge gain, continued interest in the computer science field, and a great deal of enthusiasm from students participating in a program which utilized this curriculum.";

A transversal competence is one which can be re-used when shifting to another context. Our goal is to contribute to improve Computer Science 1 (CS1) course's results by the systematic incorporation of activities based on transversal competencies. We designed a set of activities to enhance the development of transversal competencies, specially planning and time management, team work and communication skills. Hypothetically, we propose that including this kind of activities helps to obtain better results in the course. An initial experimentation was done in 2010. The preliminary results show a remarkable positive difference in student's results. In the selected group the fail rate was only 12% (3 of 25 students). In other groups, the fail rate was 32% (8 of 25 students) and 40% (8 of 20 students). In previous years, this rate was approximately 40%.";

To identify the best framework for both K-12 and higher education institutions to use to influence girls' view of Computer Science (CS), a thematic analysis of over 30 research papers and resources from the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) website was conducted. Summarizing the different successful approaches taken by various researchers in increasing the number of girls and women studying CS and categorizing the approaches based on similar themes revealed that there are four common methods used to encourage girls to pursue CS. The Four Es model- Expose, Engage, Encourage and Empower-is derived from this analysis. The model can be used by institutions as a framework to increase women and girls' interest in studying and pursuing computer science careers.";

Ironically, the requirements of their field demand skills in critical analysis and evaluation, as well as communication and collaboration skills, that are not easily acquired in the traditional classroom environment with a \"lecture\" agenda where students maintain a basically passive role. This paper describes experiments with active learning techniques performed in two different upper division computer science classes, \"Societal Issues in Computing\" and \"Computer System Security\". In spite of the traditional views of computer science as an individualistic subject matter with self centered nonsocial students, the authors have used active learning techniques in their classrooms for several semesters with encouraging results. In addition to an improved attitude and stated increased satisfaction, students' test results showed increased comprehension and improved critical reasoning abilities.";

On the one hand, it is a field deeply rooted in mathematics which resulted in strong theories.1 For example, there is computational complexity theory (turing machines, the halting problem), database theory (the relational model, expresive power of query languages), formal language theory (the chomsky hierarchy, well-formedness, formal semantics). On the other hand, it is a field deeply rooted in engineering which resulted in machines that have completely warped our society: the von Neumann architecture (the basis for digital computers), parallel processors (the new generation of multi-core machines), distributed computers (a prerequisite for the success of the internet and recent phenomena like grid computing). Consequently, computer science has inherited its research methods from the same disciplines: on the one hand, the mathematical approach with axioms, postulates and proofs; on the other hand the engineering approach with quantification, measurements and comparison.";

bibo:abstract "We conducted a study to investigate how learning styles related to the introductory Computer Science I course: the learning styles of the student population that took the course; course completion rates as they related to learning styles; relationship between the final grade in the course and learning styles; and the correlation between project and assignment completion rates and learning styles. We found that students in the course preferred active, sensing, visual and sequential learning styles. There was no significant difference in the course completion rates along any dimension that could not be explained based on prior preparation. Reflective and intuitive learners earned better grades in the course than active and sensing learners. While male students earned better grades than female students and traditionally represented students earned better grades than underrepresented students, these differences may be attributable to differences in prior preparation. In this context, SAT scores were found to be better predictors of student grades in Computer Science I than high school GPA. Programming projects in the course favored reflective students whereas online assignments favored sensing and sequential learners - unsurprising, since the design of these course instruments were congruent with the definition of these learning styles. It is hoped that this study provides insight into the types of course activities that might be incorporated into Computer Science I to accommodate the different learning styles of students.";

This paper contributes to understanding of gender inclusive learning in face to face and virtual educational environments, specifically in the context of teamwork within engineering and computer science classes. Students' experiences and perceptions of gender inclusive teamwork before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected using an online survey (N = 217). A principal component analysis revealed five components in students' reported experiences: Psychological Safety, Perceptions of the Facilitator, Confidence, Respect for Diversity, and Perceived Fairness. A multivariate analysis of covariance with gender and semester (before or during COVID-19) as the independent variables and age as the covariance found main effects only. Students' perceived psychological safety and confidence were higher in the online teamwork during COVID-19 than in the previous semester of face-to-face teamwork. The result is reassuring, as it indicates, consistent with other literature, that inclusion in student teamwork is likely to be improved when online elements are introduced.";

Supporting ways of teaching, like international seminars enable students to learn about new technologies, applications, methods and solutions used and spread on abroad universities and markets. Moreover, such seminars help students to develop soft skills, establish new personal contacts and experience cooperation with abroad teachers. All those aspects enable students to orient themselves in the possibilities of study and work abroad. This study is concentrated on the aspects of communication, understanding content in foreign languages and obtaining knowledge in presented subject. What is more students expectation about the theoretical and practical knowledge quality, learning experience, teachers skills and knowledge are evaluated. Additionally the influence of seminars on participation in student exchange programs is tested. The seminars described in the article were conducted by the educational project “A graduate of our time” granted by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education. The project covers creation of new specialisations for the Computer Science Master Degree program in Lublin University of Technology.";

Various types of digital media, such as graphics, pictures, animations, simulations, instructional games, etc., were employed to implement four types of learning objects, including examples of concrete experiences, contexts for reflective observation, conceptual models for abstract conceptualization and contexts for active experimentation. A quality evaluation of content expert review revealed that the design of ELCS instructional simulations were appropriate for learning computer science concepts as measured from the perspective of technology acceptance. Further efforts were suggested to examine the effectiveness of types of instructional simulations for the target learners.";

The changes in patterns of research output, recruitment of academic staff, and sources of research funding are discussed. It is argued that the Department became what can be considered to be a modern research-oriented enterprise, widening the scope of its research, its connections with industry and other academic departments, and its interdisciplinary research because of internal policies as well as external influences, such as government policy.<>";

Instead of simply using tools involving DM, students build such a tool and learn the relevant algorithms implemented in these tools. Some novel approaches exist in our work. We include a hands-on lab setting where students use the tool they have built to perform experiments that could ultimately extend the field. Hence, undergraduates leave the course with knowledge of performing research in computer science using a scientific method. Additionally, we have a rigorous set of evaluation criteria developed by our colleagues in the psychology department that will assess how well students learn using our novel approach. We first developed and taught this course in the Spring of 2003. The evaluation results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the students' knowledge in this area.";

bibo:abstract "Official European statistics of education indicate that the number of students entering tertiary education have significantly increased between 2000 and 2006, and indicate a trend that will continue. However, this increase is not reflected in every field of study; computer science and engineering are among those that have decreased each year, evidence of a decline of interest in following this career on the part of students. As a response to this disturbing fact, this paper aims to identify some of the possible consequences that this trend could produce in Europe. It will highlight the impacts in economic, social, political and pedagogical fields and explain how these segments will be affected if the decline in computer science persists. Supported by previous investigations and official reports, this analysis provides some examples of the problems already produced by the declining interest in computer science in Europe and proposes solutions such as teaching methods and learning strategies to attract more students to this field and therefore limit the negative effects in a near future.";

bibo:abstract "\"Why are we studying this?\" \"What area of Computer Science should I concentrate on?\" \"Are the really good Computer Scientists all hackers and nerds?\" To answer questions like these and to attract young people seeking a career that will benefit society, we describe and make a case for, a Freshman seminar course for the Computer Science (CS) major. Just as the Senior seminar is called a capstone course indicating a capping of a student's college experience, we call this Freshman seminar a cornerstone course indicating a solid foundation to build on. The purpose of the course is to provide an overview of CS. This overview forms a framework for students as they go on to study their major courses allowing them to know where they are in the landscape of CS keeping the \"big picture\" in mind. Students taking this course are more informed and can steer their way through the maze of elective courses in a more deliberate manner. It also serves as an aid in student advising and begins a process directed from the beginning toward a career goal, giving their education focus and purpose. Our course is meant to complement a Senior capstone course; topics studied in this course are reinforced in the capstone course. Ideally, this course will satisfy a general education requirement so there is no encumbrance to the major (only contribution!) and ours is written so it does just that. We cannot require our majors to take this course, only recommend that they fulfil part of their GE requirements by taking it.";

Today, most such trainings are holding online because of the obvious advantages over in-classroom training such as lower costs and a comfortable environment. Therefore, it is important to investigate the results achieved by computer science teachers in online training with in-class educations when the training has the same learning outcomes and maintained by the same instructor. As part of this research, computer science teacher's training conducted within the Oracle Academy program in the Central and Eastern Europe region were analyzed as they are held online and in-class, with the same teaching materials, with equal knowledge tests and maintained by the same instructors. The analysis found that teachers enrolled in traditional education received similar grades as those who participated in online training. However, the dropout rate for midterm and final exams was higher with online training. Teachers' feedback on the advantages and disadvantages of both types of training has recorded, with the major conclusion that they prefer online learning for their training.";

bibo:abstract "Student success and retention are major concerns for most colleges. Efforts designed to help struggling students include expanding faculty office hours, sponsoring review sessions, hiring student lab instructors, and providing tutoring labs where students may go for help. These mechanisms are described as reactive and are intended to help a student already in academic trouble. The on-going goal of this study is to identify proactive mechanisms, allowing a student's support staff to identify risk factors and intervene with support strategies before the student begins to fail. Students' levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are being studied to determine if these measures can be a more accurate predictor of student success and persistence. Secondly, this study is also attempting to determine if extrinsically motivated students can become more intrinsically motivated through innovative classroom activities and delivery methods. This WIP presents the status of this research study";

bibo:abstract "Prospective and current college students rely on Web sites for information on academic programs. This study surveyed students to determine what information they looked for on departmental Web sites. After assembling a list of desired information, two researchers visited the Web sites of 49 computer departments at universities in North Carolina and searched for the information on each site. The researchers rated the ease of finding information. Both researchers indicated that the majority of sites were attractively designed and easy to use. Comparing the results of the two researchers revealed that the sites were not as easy to navigate as the ratings indicated. In a large number of instances one or the other researcher concluded that information did not exist on a Web site, but the other researcher found it. The researchers are concerned that high school students relying on these sites to select a computer science program may draw false conclusions when selecting a school. Navigation needs to be improved to increase the usability of departmental Web sites.";

bibo:abstract "Can computer science learn from the social sciences? We focus our discussions on an undesired phenomenon that commonly affects software developers. Known as the Pygmalion effect, this phenomenon has been studied intensely by social scientists but almost entirely ignored by computer scientists. Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with his statue, Galatea, brought to life for him by Aphrodite. In the 1960s, R. Rosenthal and L. Jacobson, two American psychologists, used this myth to name an observation of theirs: whenever someone evaluates something, the evaluator's expectations concerning the evaluated object influence the evaluation, in a way that tends to prove the evaluator's initial hypothesis. Intensive studies since then have confirmed this initial observation: virtually every evaluation process in which humans intervene is prone to the Pygmalion effect, and computer science is no exception: the expectations of computer systems evaluators can strongly bias the outcome of the evaluation.";

bibo:abstract "One of the old and effective ways of training is the apprenticeship way. The effectiveness of training people in the workplace comes from different reasons. One reason may be the engagement of the apprentice in real-world problems. Another reason may be the close presence of the supervisor who provides the apprentice with scaffolding along the training process. Typically, at the beginning of the process the apprentice can't perform a lot without the scaffolding support, and towards the end of the process, scaffolding fades and the apprentice is capable of performing tasks alone. Industry and academia could benefit from this kind of model to ease the transition of undergraduate students from school to work and within each community, the transition from one level to a higher one. The authors have created a computerized apprenticeship on the Web for computer science education. It integrates the modules: 'Interactive Notes', 'Case Library', 'Problem-Solving Activities' and a 'Collaboration' module. They have focused on computer graphics as the first subject.";

bibo:abstract "Students in today's introductory Computer Science courses are often already experienced with sophisticated collaborative technologies and social computing systems. Among these popular systems are the online community building and information sharing sites that have become an intrinsic part of a new cyber-culture that continues to emerge. The involvement of students in collaborative technologies can be responsible in some cases for why certain students are inspired to pursue careers in computing disciplines. Yet very few CS 1 and CS 2 textbooks contain content related to collaborative software systems, presumably because of the extreme complexity involved in developing software that communicates with other software over a network. While social computing activities are very popular, the fact that it is not very prevalent in CS 1 and CS 2 course material can discourage students who have particular interest in that area of computing. In this paper, I present a system that I have developed that offers a simple way to incorporate class work and projects that involve collaborative networking and social computing paradigms at the level of introductory Computer Science courses.";

bibo:abstract "Tasks, understood as educational instructions to transform an initial state to a targeted state in the learner model, are central elements in (computer science) education, irrespective of the mode of delivery – online or classic face-to-face teaching. They appear in different roles; as learning objects that help acquire competencies, as assessment instruments for measuring learning success, or for practicing specific skills. However, as with any educational technology, proper handling and well-planned selection are crucial for successful teaching. Correspondingly, the requirements that tasks have to fulfill are wide-ranging: they should promote specific learning outcomes, be appropriate to address desired cognitive dimensions, and be tailored to the student to keep motivation and learning success high. To enable an on-demand, outcome-oriented, and individualized selection of tasks in adaptive learning systems, we need to formalize tasks in all dimensions. A detailed review of different models for cognitive processes, knowledge dimensions in education, tasks, and errors leads to the Y-Model, a model for formalizing tasks (in computer science). It forms the basis for an individual, competence-oriented integration of tasks in educational systems. Finally, we present the first implementation of the model.";

Students' participation in the project is on voluntary basis and development of the portfolios is not a part of assessment in the degree programme.

Development of a concept inventory for a course requires identifying course topics that are both difficult and important. This paper details how the Delphi method is being used to develop a concept inventory for CS2; in particular, it focuses on the initial process of identifying the set of topics that should be covered by a concept inventory for CS2.";

For developing countries like India, this COVID-19 testing capacity building activity seems a monstrous task, specifically due to a global shortage of testing kits and naive phase of domestic productions of testing kits. The research communities and government organizations across the world are trying to devise a methodology to grapple with this global shortage of testing kits. Pooled Sample Testing is one such methodology that has emerged recently which utilizes the testing kits optimally, where the positivity rate is low. For optimal utilization of testing kits, this article provides the theoretical study of using Computer Science, Data Structure Binary Search Algorithm in Pooled Sample testing methodology of COVID-19. The article explains how using new methodology there can be a further reduction in the number of testing kits required for identifying individual positive specimens.";

This new course, elementary programming (EP), was added as a precursor to a computer science course, object oriented programming (OOP), in order to recruit and retain technology majors. This study evaluates the course's effectiveness of its mission by analyzing student's success rates in both courses and examining factors known to contribute to declining enrollment. The cause of recruitment and retention issues are examined using computer attitude and computer experience surveys that are made available to all students enrolled in the EP course and the OOP course. The results from the fall 2006 surveys and enrollment results for the past five years support the need for the EP course and continued evaluation.";

This paper presents our experience with undergraduate research at the University of West Georgia as it enhanced student learning in the relevant areas of computer science. A number of undergraduate students were involved in various research projects related to natural language processing. Some of the students were enrolled in a newly designed faculty directed research course to earn credit while others were involved in funded research projects without enrolling in any research credit, yet there were others who participated in the research on a voluntary basis. In all cases we observed that their involvement in research enhanced their learning not only in the areas of artificial intelligence but in many other related areas of computer science. We have found that the longer a student is involved in research the better he or she is prepared for graduate school or a professional career";

In any algorithm, it is always possible to visualize its core steps with the help of a flow chart or a graph. Thus, drawing graphs and digraphs of any structure based algorithm or computer oriented outputs is much more helpful in achieving a better understanding. In discrete mathematics, digraphs based on modular arithmetic are becoming a core interest of many computer scientists and number theorist. As these digraphs are easy to label using the residues of any given integer. Thus, algorithms based on integral mathematics are easy to evaluate with the help of a power digraph. A power digraph can be constructed from the congruence equation am ≡ b(mod n), where a, b, ∈ Zn. In this note, we highlight some fields of interest where power digraphs can be utilized in a more friendly way to entertain a layman without knowing much about its mathematics.";

Nonetheless, the combination of these disciplines is rarely integrated in curricula. This work addresses this challenge presenting a case study in the context of Higher Education studies. Therefore, a project-based learning approach is presented in which students from both disciplines contribute to create and optimize IoT systems designed to track and monitor plants, soil, and environmental variables towards promoting environmental awareness in the future engineers. This research suggests at integrating these disciplines in a jigsaw classroom using specific sustainable development goals as a mediator.

The cadets must leave our course with enough understanding to thrive as students and officers in an increasingly digitized Army, and our goal is to integrate the IT (particularly networking) and programming lessons without sacrificing understanding of problem solving and basic programming constructs. By teaching problem-solving in the IT domain, instead of teaching IT and programming in distinct phases, we hope the synergy will provide a deeper understanding of information infrastructures. We ran a pilot during the Spring term of the academic year 1999-2000 to evaluate our success at achieving synergy between the IT and programming topics. The results from the pilot are very encouraging. Based on subjective evaluations by instructors and term-end exam results, it seems that we've achieved our goal of improving the cadets' understanding of both IT and problem-solving concepts.";

bibo:abstract "Computer science professional learning, widely available to 9-12 educators, has increased the number of AP CS courses offered in the U.S. and the number of students taking those courses. However, access to all CS classes remains unequal, dependent on the state, district, counselors, and teachers providing a pathway for K-12 students into the CS classrooms. A15-month project was undertaken to provide professional learning for K-12 educators to provide broader access for more students. The goal was to increase the knowledge and preparation of teachers in a wide range of school districts, as defined by socioeconomic status (SES), to meet state CS standards. Objectives included increasing the number of educators to teach CS, expanding equitable access to high-quality CS education, and providing resources to school districts to support CS education across the K-12 curriculum. Research questions include determining the most effective professional learning strategy for K-12 educators by grade band and identifying best practices to build a community of educators to support students in CS equitably. Strategies included physical and virtual events, single and multi-day workshops, individual study and out-of-class learning. Results show that 70% of the participants (n=175) came from districts with low SES factors. Short events and peer support enticed educators new to CS. In contrast, experienced CS educators wanted to meet nationally recognized norms, such as the Praxis CS examination, or learn advanced topics. These results can be used to provide more K-12 educators with CS professional learning.";

We find that months after their workshop, three years worth of participating women gave higher ratings for their knowledge and use of skills such as time management, networking, and productive mentoring relationships, as well as confidence in their promotability. These findings suggest that professional development interventions can have long lasting positive effects on mid-career women in computing, and that the type of group mentoring, role models, and community offered by CAPP can help compensate for women's reduced access to career mentoring.";

Students in noncomputer engineering major have pieces of knowledge on applications such as the products made with information technologies. They would also acquire the knowledge of the fundamental mechanism of computer and communication systems, by taking advantage of lectures. Therefore, it is important to organize the structure of their scientific knowledge by connecting those kinds of knowledge. This paper shows how we should organize various kinds of knowledge, and propose a learning style for this purpose. In addition to that, we show that a mailing list contributes to construct knowledge as a tool for cooperative learning.";

bibo:abstract "This study investigated the effects of teaching history of computing with videos of historical figures. Augmented reality (AR) techniques were applied to assist student accessing the videos of historical figures while reading a printed textbook. Whenever a student was interested in a historical figure, one could use a tablet PC to scan the figure's picture, and the corresponding video about the person would then be played on the screen. We adapted thirteen videos of historical figures in computer network field and adopted a quasi-experimental method to evaluate the effectiveness of the AR-based learning approach. Two classes of high school students, with a total of 84 students, participated in the experiment. One class of the students used Tablet PCs to access the videos of historical figures, and the other class using traditional didactic instruction served as the control group. The data collected for analysis are students' achievement test scores and answers to a questionnaire, which consists of questions on attitudes toward learning, perspectives of nature of science, and perceptions on the AR activities. Our findings showed that the AR-based historical figure videos helped students comprehend learning contents and promoted their attitudes toward learning. Students appreciated the convenience of using AR tools to access the history videos. Future research should investigate other approaches to integrate AR with the videos of historical figure, and in general, to integrate AR with other media format of computing history.";

We found that dissection is a motivating task that not only worked as desired, increasing the retention, but also improved the team productivity. Each team managed to build an adequate environment to develop its own style of work. The mixed nature of the requested work, with tactile, intellectual, research, analysis and organizational requirements was addressed to each member's personal style and allowed them to find a common way of working, subordinating their personal prominence to the efficiency of the whole.";

Although computer science teaching programs have been slower to adopt test-driven practices, test-driven learning has been used in a number of universities with generally positive results. The use of test-driven learning at the high school level is less studied. We introduce and assess the benefits of using test-driven learning in a high school Advanced Placement (AP) computer science course. This course is a strong candidate for the introduction of TDD. The Java language used in AP computer science is well-supported by TDD tools, and the concepts of TDD show promise in helping students develop the ability to analyze problem statements and develop programs. Preliminary results indicate that students respond well to the use of TDD tools to complement other teaching techniques in AP CS.";

While large costs are incurred to modify available spaces to technology-supported active classrooms, economy-based active learning systems that provide similar functionality could be employed instead. In this paper, we provide initial results for a comparison of second-semester programming course student learning outcomes. Students for an economy-based active learning system and a high-cost active learning classroom indicate through pre- and post-test results that there is little difference between delivery modes. This supports the emerging research that the activity, not the space is the dominant factor for active learning gains, which can alleviate some of the pressures for budgetarily challenged institutions of higher learning.";

bibo:abstract "New educational pedagogies are emerging in an effort to increase the number of new engineers available to enter the workforce in the coming years. One of the re-occurring themes in these pedagogies is some form of the flipped classroom. Often the additional classroom time gained from flipping is used to reinforce learning objectives. This paper suggests that it might be more beneficial to students if some of that time is used to address common non-cognitive barriers that prevent students from succeeding in the major. This experiment was conducted on a freshman Introductory Computer Science course with students whom are less traditionally prepared. Three different pedagogies were compared: a hybrid lecture-active learning pedagogy, a fully flipped classroom pedagogy, and a fully flipped classroom with added barrier interventions pedagogy. All three groups were in SCALE-UP classrooms. While fully flipping the classroom showed a slight increase to student progression over the hybrid classroom, it was not significant. When barrier interventions were added to address motivation and interest, opportunity, psychosocial skills, cognitive skills, and academic preparedness a significant increase in student progression occurred. This suggests that students might benefit from some classroom time being spent on non-technical skills.";

bibo:abstract "An approach to the teaching and learning of high school computer science (CS) to and by educationally disadvantaged students (EDS) is described. We begin by outlining six pedagogical principles for designing learning environments appropriate for EDS. Then, the implementation of one of these principles is presented. Results from years of using the CS module developed based on these principles in Israeli schools show that at the end of the module, the students master basic programming tools and recognize basic algorithmic patterns. These findings indicate the potential contribution of the approach outlined here for EDS.";

bibo:abstract "Services innovations are intensively associated with ICT innovations and adoption and diffusion of ICT. Recently, various issues and views of services have been addressed through new disciplines of services. This paper attempts to review multiple disciplines of IT services in Information Systems and Computer Science briefly. While in SSME and ITSM, the focus is mostly on planning and management of IT services, in Services Computing discipline and in service oriented domains of services such as SOA and SOI, the emphasis is on service design and operation. As we discussed in this paper, there is a call to conducting research in service-oriented technology and management for the coming decade. Also there is a rich context for researchers on services design, services development, services marketing, services delivery, services management, and services operation from behavioural, economics, technical, and organizational perspectives in computer science, information systems, e-commerce and management disciplines. For achieving any research in this area, quantitative, qualitative and experiment methods, case and field studies, and design science approaches were encouraged to be considered.";

There are several web camera based applications for predicting the students' engagement in an e-learning environment. But there are very limited works on analyzing the students' engagement using the video surveillance cameras in a teaching laboratory. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Networks based methodology for analysing the students' engagement using video surveillance cameras in a teaching laboratory. The proposed system is tested on five different courses of computer science and information technology with 243 students of NITK Surathkal, Mangalore, India. The experimental results demonstrate that there is a positive correlation between the students' engagement and learning, thus the proposed system outperforms the existing systems.";

With the increasing demand in computing-related careers, the increased enrollments in undergraduate computer science courses are facing challenges to ensure the average passing rate. In this work, we applied the muddiest point to capture student's perceptions of concepts of difficulty and used self-efficacy to better contextualize students' perfections of self-efficacy in relation to concepts of difficulty. In this paper we present the results of one section of one introductory computing course, that revealed the perceived difficult topics as well as changes in self-efficacy throughout the semester. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between self-efficacy and performance.";

bibo:abstract "Shippensburg University offers a B.S. in Computer Science degree with a concentration in software engineering. In addition to a core of computer science classes, this concentration contains three four credit software engineering courses. The main goal of this concentration is to prepare the students to be able to measure the software development process and enact appropriate modifications. This requires that they must be aware that there are a variety of software process alternatives and when various aspects of each process might be beneficial. In addition, they need to be able to apply appropriate statistical analysis to assess the process. In order to accomplish this, our software engineering concentration includes three software engineering specific courses: traditional lifecycle, testing & extreme programming, and software metrics/project management. In the first two courses, the students work in teams to develop products for customers using two disciplined, but very different, processes (a variation of TSP and XP). By comparing these experiences, the students learn about making the choices that software engineers have to make regularly. In software metrics, we study methods of assessing risks, the process, and modifications to the process. This paper describes these courses and the results of our assessment of these courses.";

While such disparities are seen at particular schools, such disparities do not exist in disciplinary courses such as history, math, or science where all students are required to take these courses. This paper discusses an approach to broaden minority participation in computing through the integration of Computer Science (CS) into a history course. This poster proposes an alignment between computational thinking and historical thinking that makes history courses an attractive fit for CS integration. It also presents results from the pilot study of a project-based cross-disciplinary curriculum using MIT App inventor that leverages students' interests in mobile technology to facilitate the creation of historical mobile apps. This curricular approach is built on a theoretical framework rooted in Constructivist and Constructionist learning where students construct and produce knowledge, artifacts, and technology rather than consume them. Our initial results suggest that students were engaged in the material and were enthusiastic about the creation of their mobile app.";

Nowadays, Educational Management Systems store a large amount of data from the interaction of not only students and professors but also of students and the educational environment. Analyze and find patterns manually from a huge amount of data is hard, so Educational Data Mining (EDM) is widely used. This work uses the CRISP-DM methodology and data from Computer Science Undergraduate students from Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil. The results are shown for three algorithms: the Decision Tree algorithm presents a precision of 84.80%, a Recall of 85.80% and an AUC of 77.24%; the Random Forest algorithm presents a precision of 88.57%, a Recall of 90.14% and an AUC of 83.22%; the Logistic Regression algorithm presents a precision of 71.24%, a Recall of 94.28% and an AUC of 58.39%. The results indicate that it is possible to use a prediction model using only the data from the first three semesters of the course.";

The computer science mainstream has been focused upon the understanding and creation of discourse between humans and, more specifically, between humans and their informational resources, both human and machine. This is in contrast with the common and predominate institutional view that the computer is an arithmetic engine. The present and potential informational resources valuable to a human require little concern for arithmetic. The human value of informational resources results through aiding the human's ability to externalize models of issues, things, or events, i.e., the key to understanding and then communicating, Interactive computing issues will continue to be the driving force of computer science resulting in eventual common awareness that the computer is a populist communications medium.";

In the summer of 2008, a computational chemistry program for high school students was held at Rhode Island College which incorporated several different modules which combined biology, chemistry, and computer science. One of these modules focused on computer-aided drug design. Here, we describe the objectives, methods, achievements, and future goals of that aspect of the program where a high school student, mentored by a graduate student, used eHiTS Lightning on a Sony PlayStation 3 in order to identify molecules which may be potential cancer therapeutics.";

Such a system would be vastly beneficial for exchange students as it could provide them a metric when choosing their destination. Driven by that need, a web application named CSyllabus was developed. After acquiring initial course data, currently from 11 universities, minimal attributes found throughout the dataset were defined. Course comparison algorithm was implemented using Latent Semantic Indexing from Gensim library based on comparing aforementioned attributes. To provide institutions the means to manage their syllabi data, keeping it precise and up-to-date, REST API was built with a supporting administration panel. Following the release, a poll was taken among users to evaluate the influence and usefulness of the CSyllabus web application.";

Computer Science students are usually taught theoretical disciplines with very few laboratory experiences, especially including real systems. In this paper we want to present a course for Bachelor students in Computer Science which is based on laboratory experiences and aims at making the students familiar with physical systems modeling and control, haptics and human-robot interaction. The course has been recently introduced at the University of Verona as a pilot experiment, with positive reactions from the students. We will describe the proposed method and its integration with the current curriculum in our University. The goals of the course are: the application of theoretical concepts from different disciplines to a real system (haptic paddle); the introduction of the human factor in such real system and its analysis; the improvement of the students ability to solve problems when facing real systems; the improvement of transversal knowledge, such as autonomously finding a solution using previous knowledge, performing scientific experiments, team work, collecting and reporting scientific results.";

This paper shows how several of the main principles of distributed systems have a “natural” mapping in distributed games, thus inducing their deep comprehension in the developers of the game. We discuss an experimentation that lasted several years, involving students of computer science, at the forth year of their curricula in our University. The course in distributed systems requires the design and implementation of a distributed game, and the students are requested to perform that task in small groups. The students are requested to design and implement a Web based game between peers, avoiding any form of centralization during the game playing. Moreover, the game has to be tolerant to some kind of faults, keeping coherent behavior for the correct players.";

The idea of smart environments as networking embedded computers to complete everyday tasks provides strong possibilities for context orientation, including smart homes, smart cities, and Industry 4.0. In particular, the context smart home offers teachers exciting and versatile possibilities to introduce students to computer science. It enables teaching programming, networks, communication protocols, and electrical engineering in a student-oriented manner. In order to provide teachers with a low-barrier opportunity to use this context in computer science classes, we developed a smart-environments learning kit. The kit contains hardware that can be easily interconnected and recombined, leaving plenty of room for individual development and internal differentiation. First pilot uses of the kit in different learning groups revealed room for improvement: For instance, preparing the boards in computer science classes is too time-consuming, and the open-source firmware of the hardware modules is too complex to be covered in class. Following a design-based research approach, this work-in-progress paper documents lessons learned from the piloting implementations and illustrates potential solutions.";

bibo:abstract "This Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper presents our approach in designing and incorporating deliberate practices based on micro-credentials for a CS1 (introduction to computer science) course. Based on a set of more than 100 micro-credentials we have created for this course, we designed deliberate questions for each lecture based on the micro-credentials students are supposed to acquire. The deliberate questions are relatively short questions focusing on specific skills/ability, coupled with skill assessments. These deliberate questions are used in our in-class exercise sections, in which we encourage students to practice, give students timely feedback and support them in correcting their code. We compared students' performance in the current semester (spring 2019) with another section of the same CS1 course one year ago (spring 2018). Our data analysis shows that students are more likely to participate and finish the daily exercises, and perform better in formal tests. Besides, using deliberate questions based on micro-credentials can provide instructors information on students overall competencies on different micro-credentials, thus allow instructors to design interventions accordingly.";

bibo:abstract "We build on the success of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum, which has improved the accessibility of a Computer Science education to students of all backgrounds. While ECS has been well-received by its students and successful in reaching many students of diverse backgrounds, it currently suffers from a final module which is expensive and offers no easy transition to text-based programming. This module, which teaches robotics as an application of computing, rests on the LEGO Mindstorms1 platform. The Mindstorms have a block-based programming language that abstracts too much code to be of any use for making a transition from block-based programming to text-based programming. They are also more expensive than most schools can afford. This paper reports on one aspect of our successful effort to create an alternative curriculum which meets the same curriculum objectives as the current sixth module, but for a reduced price.";

bibo:abstract "Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.";

To understand the mitigating factors influencing Latinas' enrollment and persistence in engineering and computer science, an interdisciplinary team of scholars at a majority Hispanic four-year institution has undertaken a three-year project to explore these phenomena. The following overarching question has guided us: What is the relationship among identity, resilience, and persistence of Latinas in computer science and engineering? The study was framed using a sociocultural theory of identity drawn from the work of Gee and from Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, and Cain. Our findings suggest the majority of women encountered and dealt with some kind of adversity in their career trajectory. Their ability to overcome this adversity depended on many factors, such as the role of peer groups, family, and professors. Eighteen of the 26 participants referenced group participation phenomenon as beneficial to their success. They also identified spaces that accommodate group interaction including: the library, homes, local coffee shops, and university study areas.";

The authors have developed visualization courseware to both add more structure to the lab and to enhance lectures. In the lab, students interact with the module individually. The student may explore the module or may be responding to a written set of directions. Sometimes the lab is used by the instructor to specify a problem. In other cases the module takes students through the steps needed to solve a problem. One result of this effort has been the development and use of a PC-based simulated robot environment to introduce students to programming.<>";

The authors' research employed two categories of HO scale model train systems. The first was the traditional version available at most hobby shops. The second was an intelligent version which uses independent microprocessors in each cab for advanced control. Each system proved well suited for certain specific lab objectives, and together spanned the applications spectrum. Model trains have also helped to energize the curriculum fusion process. There are numerous reasons for using model trains in a computer science and electrical engineering curriculum. Model trains stimulate student interest because they are fun and can be used to simulate complex systems. Model trains have proven to be a flexible tool, being utilized in the basic digital logic course through the capstone design project. Considering the relatively small cost of a model train set, model trains can be a cost effective tool to model such things as a state machine, collision avoidance, and deadlock avoidance.";

A work in collaborative techniques in computer science has focused on programming, but our work examines the effects of the workshops on the discrete mathematics, data structures, and algorithms courses. Most of our students transfer from community college and are commuter students, spending little time on campus and thus studying alone. An approach similar to Treisman's could improve the performance of students with these characteristics. A preliminary analysis suggests that the workshops have an impact on student performance in the discrete mathematics and algorithms courses. Our work extends the previous work in calculus by adapting the workshops to computer science and applying similar analysis methods to determine efficacy. In addition, to provide insight for future workshop implementation, our work seeks to understand how students solve computer science problems. We do so by analyzing student responses in interviews involving a problem solving task";

bibo:abstract "This paper presents our experience of using a social software development environment called SCI to support teaching programming for software engineering and computer science courses. It describes the benefit from using a Social Development Environment (SDE), particularly the effect of integrating the social side on students for the computer science classroom. This paper presents a study that tests the usability of the SCI social development environment. Also, it contributes to a test of the hypotheses that discuss 1) the effect of using collaborative virtual environments, and 2) the benefits from integrating social networking within the SCI development environment. It presents both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the SCI's environment effectiveness in a computer science classroom. User observation, informal discussions and feedback via a questionnaire gave promising facts about the system. Students have reported that the tool eases communication between them and their project partners, and that the tool presented them with passive awareness information that prevented them from affecting other's work and conflict changes while working on the project artefacts.";

bibo:abstract "Computer science as a pedagogical discipline continues to advance rapidly, and this advance necessitates frequent revision of the curriculum. One of the fundamental changes in computer science is the realization that the context and impact of new technologies need to be taken into account in its design, partly because of the ethical implications of its use, and partly because understanding the consequences of use helps to inform and improve the design. Project ImpactCS was funded by the National Science Foundation in 1994 with the goal to define the conceptual framework, core content, and pedagogical objectives for integrating social impact and ethics into the computer science curriculum.";

The purpose of the intelligent questioning system is to improve the educational process in engineering courses by allowing students to learn more in less time, to understand more deeply, and to enjoy their learning experience. Key elements of this system are a question model and an adaptive question management system that uses a hierarchical knowledge map to direct the learning process based on the student's degree of understanding of individual or grouped concepts. Although there are several online computer based questioning systems, they typically have no built-in help, no guidance if questions are answered incorrectly, no method for selecting questions based on the student's needs, and no comprehensive monitoring of a student's progress through a knowledge map of the course and the overall curriculum. The knowledge map is a formal representation of the knowledge to be imparted to students in a program of study. In addition, the knowledge map has sufficient structure to capture a model of each student's progression. It provides a graphical map of the concepts that a student has learned and the degree of understanding for each concept.";

The SWDCS Research Alliance is a research-practitioner partnership of computer science and special educators. The purpose of this preliminary study is to increase African American and Hispanic students with disabilities' interest, engagement, learning, knowledge, and persistence in CS and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers. This project employs a project-based voice user interface (VUI) and artificial intelligence (AI) instruction, and tech mentoring. Of the 21 teachers participating in the Alliance, the research team identified a convenience sample of eight teachers to participate in semi-structured, focus group interviews. Using an inductive thematic analysis approach, the researchers identified the following emergent themes: limitations of school or administrative policies for African American and Hispanic SWD enrolling in CS classes, lack of CS-focused interventions for African American and Hispanic SWD, lack of formal teacher preparation for CS teachers to work with SWD, and structural barriers limiting SWD, Hispanic, and Black students' enrollment in CS classes. This study fills the gap in the literature concerning minority SWD's experiences in CS education.";

bibo:abstract "As the processing power of computers has increased, more complex and larger problems have been introduced. The lack of a disciplined approach to the solution of such problems has created a situation referred to as the \"software crisis\". That is, software products have been behind schedule, over budget and unreliable. The Software Engineering Institute (SEI), through the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), has addressed a software organization's capability with five maturity levels. CMM is based on a team approach to software production. Watts Humphrey, in the Personal Software Process (PSP) concept, addresses the roles and processes that individual team members should follow in order to be an effective member of a team. PSP is being taught to software engineers in different industries and also to graduate students in mainly Master of Software Engineering (MSE) programs. In their experiment the authors started teaching a simplified version of PSP to freshmen in the Computer Science program. The result of the experiment has shown that the students have gained better time management and defect management skills, which are the basis for more effective software production. The paper describes how to incorporate a disciplined software development process into the first introductory computer science programming courses, with the major emphasis on the first course. They share some of their initial results.";

bibo:abstract "Pokemon Go is a mobile device based game that is very popular among teenagers. The game is based on the Geographic Information System (GIS) that utilizes the player's location and interacts with many fancy characters stored in local databases, and occasionally some information stored in remote databases. The game requires a lot of computations for distances, rules, and interactions. In this paper, we propose an innovative method for young students to learn about computer science through GIS and Pokemon Go. It is very important for young students to know that computer science is not just only about coding, but also involves many other interesting topics such as security, networking, animation, modeling, graphic and interface design, databases, user experiences (UX), requirement design, technical writing, etc. The purpose of this paper is to document how to encourage young students interested in pursuing careers in computer science and technology fields.";

bibo:abstract "Students in the introductory computer science classes are usually given relatively small programs that help the students learn new concepts covered in class. The students need to focus on the new material and giving them a large project is counter-productive to them learning the important concepts. I wanted to challenge the students in our second computer science course by giving them a large project without overwhelming them. To accomplish this I gave them a project that was accomplished in various stages throughout the semester. This paper discusses the various stages of the project and how they fit together so at the end of the semester the students had a large comprehensive project. Also, I wanted a project the students would be excited about doing. A drawing project that allowed the user of the program to draw lines, rectangles, ovals, text, and free hand lines with various colors and having the option to fill or not fill closed objects was selected. The finished project covered the following topics from the second computer science class: graphical interface design, event handling, color control, arrays, inheritance, polymorphism and singly linked list. The students were challenged for this project and enjoyed the finish product.";

bibo:abstract "Increasing the participation of underrepresented students in computing requires increasing the inclusion of computing as part of their identity. Research suggests that ethnic identity, including the presence of role models of the same ethnicity, directly influences the self-efficacy of minorities in career choices and development. If properly measured, then identity can be used to assess the impact of many of the current and forthcoming national K-12 efforts to increase diversity in CS. The Computer Science Attitude and Identity Survey (CSAIS) was developed to measure five constructs that influence undergraduate students of color in computer science: confidence, interest, gender, professional, and identity. The tool extends from the Engineering Students’ Attitudes toward CS Survey (designed for first-year CS majors and non-majors) and the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM), a psychology-based survey for measuring ethnic identity according to the following factors: ethnic identity search and affirmation, commitment, and sense of belonging. Validation results indicated that the identity construct is a valid and reliable measure of ethnic identity in relation to CS. This work is now focused on data collection for various efforts targeting underrepresented students nationwide.";

The first hypothesis predicted that teaching Computer Science without the use of ICT will meet students' educational needs and objectives (H1). The second hypothesis predicted that the use of electronic materials in Computer Science classes will enable students to reach a higher level of knowledge in Computer Science (H2), whereas the third hypothesis stated that the students who attend Computer Science classes in which the teaching method included electronic learning will be more satisfied with the acquired knowledge than other students (H3).

bibo:abstract "Today's students have been surrounded by information technologies since birth and most often have no patience to learn programming as it is commonly defined in the traditional curriculum. The modern Croatian Curriculum of Informatics in Elementary and Secondary School defines the learning outcomes and (with certain recommendations) is giving complete freedom and responsibility to the teacher in the design of teaching during which the students will achieve the anticipated learning outcomes. However, today's society and the national economy expect a growing number of educated professionals in the field of information technology, but it is unfortunately not happening. In addition to motivating students, different extracurricular activities can be provided by the teacher, as well as other stakeholders who may not specialize in teaching in cooperation with the school (parents, volunteers, sponsors...). Taking into account the already implemented examples of good practice in Croatian schools, this paper lists examples of globally successful curriculum from Oracle Academy program, which are better known under the name Workshops in a Box. The paper also presents a short survey on the current implementation of computer science extracurricular programs in the Croatian schools.";

dblp:title "Accessibility of Work-Integrated Learning in Engineering, IT, and Computer Science for Students with Disabilities";
bibo:abstract "Universities put significant resources into supporting students with disabilities on campus. However, this support from universities can be limited off-campus. With universities and governments strongly advocating for the inclusion of Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) placements in all programs, particularly in technical areas such as engineering, IT, and computer science, students with disabilities are increasingly expected to leave campus to attain their degree. In these arrangements the expectations are unclear and greatly vary, with most employers taking full responsibility for students on a day-to-day basis. Although engineering, IT, and computer science industries have become more open to and inclusive of diverse workforces in recent years, student WIL experiences can vary dramatically between employers and this can leave students vulnerable to the culture and accessibility of the workplace they undertake WIL activities in. Additionally, many programs require students to find their own placements, which is challenging given the reportedly low employment opportunities available to people with disabilities. In this paper, we recommend that students with disabilities need to be considered more than they currently are in the design of WIL placement programs and that programs could provide greater support to these students to ensure the positive outcomes associated with WIL are equitable for all students. It is also suggested that work needs to be done to bring students with disabilities into the conversation through co-design and participatory research in order to understand what their experiences are like in WIL and how universities and employers can better support them to reach their goals.";

bibo:abstract "A research design has been created for the WMU Introductory Computer Science Course that will leverage existing published research with classroom research to identify from student perspectives the key barriers to their own success. As these barriers are identified and articulated, there will be proactive changes made in the course material, a set of activities, use of assessment, and course structure to help the students increase their success. Success is being measured in several dimensions: obtaining an A, B, or C in the course; obtaining an A, B, C, in the required linked subsequent course; students' self-direct learning skills; their problem solving skills; and their ability to take on the perspective of and perform the role of a computer scientist. The paper provides a list of the identified issues/barriers, and addresses these issues/barriers by applying at least two interventions. Also, there is a detailed description of what was attempted and what the qualitative impact of these interventions was at the time of implementation, as well as a summative assessment on the whole course. A research plan for follow-on study is discussed to open up more collaboration with other institutions, to develop new intervention strategies, and to redefine the structure of the course to continually increase the percentage of students who are successful.";

However, as most academic journals and conferences use English as the publication language, new terms are usually introduced in English. As a consequence, introduction of new terms to other languages became harder. This problem is more evident in dynamic fields like Informatics where new terms are frequently introduced. In this work as a solution to this problem, a system for producing an English-Turkish terminology is constructed. Using the English and Turkish abstracts of thesis produced by Turkish universities terminology dictionary is formed automatically. Two existing methods in the literature are used and compared. One of the methods is modified for Turkish and extended to create a more comprehensive dictionary. Created system is able to automatically update itself with new terms using the new publications. Experiments evaluating the accuracy of the system is conducted using a manually built Informatics Terminology. The proposed algorithm is able to improve both the precision and recall of the system.";

Furthermore, we compare the teaching situation in an e-learning course in statistics in an engineering program taught completely online with the findings in an e-learning statistics course taught as the only e-learning course in the curriculum.";

bibo:abstract "The emergence of network interconnection technology promotes collaboration and the sending of large amounts of data into the network. In fact, we are at a time when entities are forced to share their data in a collaborative working environment and mutualisation. Data exchanged through collaborative networks is constantly growing. As part of a virtual organization, as in the case of distributed networks or digital universities, actors often have to exchange large data in the form of images, sounds and videos. This plethora of large data creates slowdowns within the network and dramatically slows the flow. Data compression is a mandatory solution. This article proposes to provide a solution on compression and data transmission techniques. The compression technique consists of using a polynomial formula to compress the data to the maximum before its transmission. This makes it possible to send large amounts of data faster, to gain bandwidth and to increase the fluidity of transmissions. So the knots will be less loaded.";

In the labs, students work on some programming assignment problems and submit them on an online platform to be graded by instructors. The labs are designed to get students hands-on coding and implement the programs on the computer. Traditionally, the grading feedback is provided after a week or more, many of which are ignored by the students. As such, in this work, a one-on-one grading feedback methodology on completion of the program in the lab was conducted. Along with feedback, instructors would ask various questions to students related to the problem to understand their knowledge, thinking process and at the same time, enhance the communication skills of students. A quantitative study of the process using survey data showed that this method had a positive impact on students without causing any additional burden on instructors.";

Many assignments are strictly dictated by what textbooks suggest as valuable learning experiences, as long as they can be completed in just a few class periods. The number of students taking a computer science course continues to dwindle, as does the number of teachers certified to teach computer science. Building on two case studies of EPICS High in computer science classrooms, this paper will open discussion and explore novel ways of engaging computer science teachers and students through compelling community-based service-learning projects using engineering design concepts. As it is EPICS High's mission is to be a leader in developing, disseminating, and supporting service-learning models that engage high school students in engineering and computing-based design projects that meet the needs of their communities, EPICS High intends to build relationships with computer science teachers to learn the best way this model can be implemented in their courses and help these teachers pilot an EPICS project that connects with their community.";

bibo:abstract "The ability to work on a diverse team is among the desirable skills for college graduates. Especially in STEM, students are expected to work with people from backgrounds different from their own. Research has shown that STEM students find working with people from diverse backgrounds to be challenging because their education has not prepared them to do so. It is crucial for educators to take the initiative and integrate the concepts of intercultural competence into the curriculum from the first year onwards. In this work-in-progress paper, we discuss the impact of an interactive online module on the development of the intercultural competence of twenty-five first-year computer science students. After completing the online module, students were required to reflect on a scenario where the student's role was to manage a culturally diverse team. The students were asked to identify the cultural differences that could lead to conflicts on the team and to reflect on the ways cultural differences could benefit the team. The study used a qualitative approach to analyze students' final reflections. The data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis to identify the emerging themes and patterns. The results of the study showed that students recognized the following challenges: i) a mix of individualist and collectivist orientations, ii) differences in work orientations (task vs relationship-oriented), iii) age and seniority differences among employees, and iv) differences in communication styles (direct vs indirect). The corresponding benefits identified for each challenge were: i) facilitating team process, ii) promoting team bonding and task completion, iii) developing different approaches to solving problems using multiple lenses, and iv) promoting adaptation and creating learning opportunities. Overall, the results of this study are encouraging as they show that after engaging in an online module which incorporates elements of transformative learning, especially self-reflection, and the ARCS model for developing engaging activities, first-year computer science students are able to identify elements of different worldviews impacting culturally diverse teams and the potential challenges and benefits stemming from them.";

bibo:abstract "There are many teaching strategies in higher education; one of these is discussion-based teaching which aims to stimulate conversation and peer learning. Although this teaching strategy has many benefits for students, such as learning how to argue, it has not gained much traction in STEM subjects like Computer Science. However, soft skills have become increasingly important within these fields. A focus when recruiting for roles is not only on hard skills such as programming but also on the ability to communicate well with stakeholders. This paper explores and evaluates an approach to incorporate discussion-based teaching within computer science education, focusing on teaching hard and soft skills. To achieve this, we organised an emulated program committee type of activity for MSc students at our university. We evaluated the activity by asking the students to complete a survey and followed this up by interviewing several students to gather more in-depth reactions from the cohort. The results show that students feel they learnt about the topics tackled within the papers we have chosen, gained more confidence to tackle paper writing, understood the requirements of academic work, and improved their soft skills such as academic writing. The interviews show that students thoroughly enjoyed the activity and are keen to have more interactive discussion sessions like this.";

This paper presents the curricular structure and assessment methods of a new computer science program and describes how it has met ABET/CACpsilas current criteria. The program adopted a set of outcomes for computer science that are aligned closely with those associated with engineering programs. Faculty connected their courses to the program outcomes with specific course outcomes, which are assessed quantitatively by multiple measurement methods. The end result is a program assessment procedure that fulfills the intent of ABET/CACpsilas criteria, provides the program with useful and actionable feedback, and does so without imposing an undo burden on faculty. The outcomes originally chosen for this program are a close fit with the program outcomes listed in ABETpsilas recently published ldquo2008-2009 Criteria for Accrediting Computing Programs - New Criteriardquo, thus the structure presented in this paper may be applicable to programs undergoing a transition to these new criteria.";

bibo:abstract "The demand for cybersecurity professionals is projected to grow substantially, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that employment in cybersecurity within the US will grow by 18% from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. As creating a cyberspace workforce has become a matter of national security for every country, cybersecurity needs to be taught at all levels, to all students, in the educational system. The good news is that cybersecurity is also a topic that students from a wide variety of backgrounds find interesting, and as a result, it motivates them to study computing too. Over the past two decades, there has been an increased effort worldwide to incorporate computer science and computational thinking into the middle and high school curriculum. The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course. The approach builds on an CSP course that was created from a previous collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, and the Webster Central School District in Webster, New York. The paper discusses the background, details of the earlier CSP course, how relevant cybersecurity content was identified, and then integrated into the CSP course to create the CyberCSP variant of the Computer Science Principles course.";

bibo:abstract "Women and ethnic minorities remain underrepresented in Computer Science (CS) major. The goal of this study is to examine the persistence among underrepresented students (URS) in introductory CS courses. This full paper describes an exploratory study to identify which non-cognitive factors such as academic performance satisfaction, learning assistance, peer interaction, and sense of belonging may help in predicting URS's intention to persist in CS major. Results suggest that academic performance satisfaction plays an important role in students' persistence in general. Also, studying with peers may increase women's intention to persist in CS. However, academic support has a negative association with ethnic minorities' persistence in the major. These findings can be used to make decisions to improve students' retention in CS. Implications of these results are discussed.";

bibo:abstract "Today's technological advancements in mobile technologies and the growing number of mobile devices are extremely beneficial in the mobile learning process. This study is a work in progress that discusses the possibilities of integrating Augmented Reality (AR) and computer vision (CV) into science education which uses deep learning to detect animals in real-time and teach children to classify animals, and learn about their habitat, sound, and important facts. In this study, the Design Science Research (DSR) is used which is a pragmatic approach to creating substantial knowledge for problem-solving through the development of artifacts. The mobile application - AnimalCircle - was developed following the DSR method, and initial users' study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of the use of AR and CV in mobile learning on children's science education and if it can enhance children learning experience. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with children studying at primary level class in Kathmandu district of Nepal between the age groups of 6–12. The findings show that children are positive toward usage of AnimalCircle app in their learning process because they find it beneficial and effective in their learning. However, most children also found it difficult and complained of getting confused during their initial usage. Therefore, significant efforts are required to improve the usage of these technologies in the mobile app and to provide a child-friendly learning experience.";

bibo:abstract "The traditional approach to teaching CS1, begins with a short introduction and proceeds quickly to the syntax of a programming language, followed by functions, modules, abstract data types, data structures, algorithm complexity analysis and so on. Students think in a narrow language specific context, without an overview of design. Students mistakenly believe that the difficult and most important part of solving a problem using a computer is the translation into a specific programming language. No wonder that CS1 is considered to be the most stressful course for beginning college students. Students, working in isolation at home or in a laboratory, do not know if their errors are due to a lack of understanding of the concepts of computing, lack of understanding of the syntax and semantics of the programming language, some error(s) in the logic of their algorithm, failure to understand the cryptic or misleading error messages, or, occasionally, computer systems errors. This new approach attempts to avoid this frustration. The first year sequence supports students by allowing them to concentrate on concepts first, work in groups, learn object-oriented design very early, and gain a broad picture of computing from the very beginning. The details of the syntax and semantics are left for the second course.";

bibo:abstract "Largely because of the complex nature of wireless communications research, academia has been slow to respond to strong industry and government demands for trained professionals to develop and apply novel wireless techniques to the rapidly-growing demand. There is a high demand for professionals with a background in wireless. Wireless engineers and scientists are needed to analyze, index, represent, model, simulate, and process large volumes of calls made everyday on wireless systems. The development of an undergraduate curriculum in Computer Science and Engineering is essential to meeting the future needs of the industry. This must be initiated immediately so that students can be a part of the basic research of this emerging field and immediately available to meet the workforce needs of the technology world. At the present time Virginia State University has no undergraduate and/or graduate program in wireless communications and it would be essential to initiate the development of such a program for the future. The faculties at the Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science and Engineering and Technology have been closely collaborating in an effort to enhance their graduates through scientific cooperation to establish research, as well as a curricular option in wireless communications. The proposed changes will enhance and strengthen such collaboration with research capacity in the area of the wireless communications at VSU for faculty and students.";

English Language Learners are students who come from non-English speaking homes and backgrounds. With the increasing numbers of Hispanic students in many K-12 classrooms, Spanish is the language most often spoken by English Language Learners. Advanced Placement Computer Science teachers will utilize strategies from Sheltered Instruction, an educational model from English as a Second Language and Bilingual education, in their classrooms. The impact of this approach will be measured by comparing the exam scores of students in the classroom of participating teachers with the 2020 national and state Advanced Placement Computer Science exam scores. Research outcomes of the pedagogical interventions explored will be widely utilized for teaching Computer Science to all English Language Learners, including Hispanics.";

The primary appeal associated with employing robots is that they tend to capture the attention of the target audience and thereby facilitate the learning process. While there are numerous robotic kits on the market today, few can be used to teach both high-level concepts in computer science and engineering as well as low-level concepts in a K-12 environment and those that are capable, are more expensive. In this paper we propose an affordable setup of a basic software and hardware framework to accomplish this interaction. Specifically, the overall system architecture, low-cost robot, Web service and mobile device software will be the topics of interest in this paper.";

A comparative study is under preparation in which this relationship is to be examined. The study will compare the intuitive understanding of computer science concepts between Saudi student groups of different English language proficiency levels and of different maturity levels. A test has been designed in order to reveal differences in the perception of computer science concepts that can be attributed to such background differences. The study will serve as a starting point for further work on how computer science education can be enhanced for students that are non-native English speakers.";

bibo:abstract "Increasing minority representation in the field of Computer Science has been a focal point of concern. Outreach activities, after-school programs, and summer camps are common efforts that have been employed in an attempt to reverse this trend of underrepresentation in the field. There have also been instances in which these efforts were found to be successful [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, these efforts appear to occur more often in urban areas of the United States. Meanwhile, there are rural areas that contain a substantial representation of minorities, in particular African-Americans. In states like Alabama and Mississippi, for instance, 51.4% and 72.4% of its residents respectively live in rural areas [5]. Yet, both states also possess a denser population of African-Americans as residents than the national average [6]. Employing efforts of a similar prevalence seen within urban areas towards rural areas could further assist the cause of alleviating minority underrepresentation in computer science. This poster details an outreach effort that was conducted on a group of African-American juniors at a rural high school (named Aliceville High School) in Pickens County, Alabama. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pickens County is composed of ∼20,000 residents in which ~41% are African-American [6]. Furthermore, the student representation at Aliceville High School is predominantly African-American. Using an interactive robotic environment called PREOP (Providing Robotic Experiences through Object-based Programming), the objective was to expose these students to robotic programming with the intent of encouraging and engaging them to the idea of viewing computer science as a possible career choice. Upon the completion of this outreach, it was found that nearly half of the students exhibited some level of interest for pursuing computer science as a potential career choice.";

The graduate students, called fellows, worked in secondary classrooms in the Cincinnati Public Schools District as a part of Project STEP at the University of Cincinnati, which is funded by the National Science Foundation GK-12 Program. The fellows formed partnerships with secondary math and science teachers to generate new lessons, activities, and resources to enhance the STEM skills of high school students. Additionally, the Fellows used their engineering expertise to bring authentic learning experiences into the classroom and introduced concepts in their field of engineering to underserved student populations. This paper discusses observations and reflections by the fellows regarding aspects of the activities that had the most impact on student learning and interest in engineering, which was measured by self-reported student surveys";

A survey questionnaire was developed and tested for its validity, and then it was used to collect data from 65 high school students to find if there is any relationship between the students' interests in a CS degree and the three suggested variables. Students' gender was the moderating variable in the data analysis. The results show that two variables can be used as predictors for female students' interest, and only one predictor for male students' interest.";

bibo:abstract "In K-12 computing education, students are usually supported to learn key disciplinary concepts and practices with little attention to critical issues. Rather than separating the two learning goals, we redesigned an electronic textiles learning activity within the Exploring Computer Science introductory curriculum to extend computing concepts and practices to include the implications of computing systems. Our redesign was guided by the following principles: (a.) Making connections and building on students' lived experiences; (b.) Centering people and interactions; and, (c.) Highlighting the implications of computing. In this poster, we report on how these principles were adopted to redesign a learning activity to support critical computational engagement. We recommend future redesign efforts of existing curricular learning activities to re-conceive the very “computing system” to consider the implications of computing.";

bibo:abstract "In an effort to increase opportunities for under represented students to pursue 4-year Computer Science, Networking and Telecommunications degrees, the University of Pittsburgh initiated the Technology Leadership Institute (TLI). TLI is a six-week summer pre- college program for under represented high school students. Experience from the first year illustrates the need to create a culturally relevant curriculum that maps Computer Science to familiar experiences and interests. The limited classroom time with students over the summer forces the design of the curriculum to be concise and comprehensive, yet engaging. The curriculum includes basic and intermediate courses with content in Computer Programming, Web Design, Computer Systems, and Mathematics. This work in progress describes the preliminary design and implementation processes and focuses on what should be taught and to a lesser degree the pedagogy. TLI provides an avenue for students to learn about the vast scope of Computer Science, educational and career opportunities, in addition to obtaining transferable knowledge and skills. The curriculum is assessed by an external evaluation team that will collect, analyze and report student-identified competency, student perceptions and interests, as well as actual achievement levels. Results from this study will be useful in curriculum development of Computer Science courses at the K-12 level, as well as providing strategies to underrepresented groups to explore computer science.";

The proposed research will explore cognitive, affective and social factors that contribute to success in engineering education and computer science with one central question: How does the student's state of mind (mind-state) influence the physical process of learning which then can lead to academic success. Under investigation are the differences with mind-state in response to learning in engineering and computer science, and the relational images that explain the quality and quantity of bow the student respondents constructed success. Defining and implementing research measures for mind-state is a central part of this project. Quantitative, qualitative, medical, and projective methods will include samples that reflect variations in mind states reported by male and female participants, in mixed-sex and same sex environments, by race, by discipline and by major.";

Because of the increasing number of students who are interested in learning programming, the department has to provide at least half a dozen of sessions each semester. Those sessions are usually taught by several faculty members, and in our case, the department has no guidelines on the course design other than a set of student learning outcomes. The instructors of each session can make course design decisions by themselves, including the textbook to use, the material to cover, etc. In this project, we present a course design methodology based on a common set of micro-credentials for this course. Micro-credentials are a set of academic competencies which the instructors expect the students to develop in the course. This paper presents one instructor's course evaluation and redesigning process, showing micro-credentials can help instructors identify the topics which are not covered sufficiently. The process presented in this project could also be used to align the course designs of different instructors on the same course.";

bibo:abstract "Recent advances in AI-generated code could potentially be plagiarized by students in entry-level programming courses. This paper examines the use of ChatGPT for generating code to solve a programming project for an entry-level computer science course. We analyzed 59 anonymized student samples along with 75 regular generations of ChatGPT code and 75 samples of ChatGPT code prompted directly for obfuscation. Results showed that 44% of ChatGPT-generated code did not compile in three or fewer manual fixes. Additionally, plagiarism detection software was not easily able to flag AI-generated code. However, the results showed that AI -generated code was more dissimilar in comparison to student-generated code, which could potentially aid in automated detection.";

This information takes into account the documents' publication date in order to construct time series which are analyzed and interpreted looking for trends. Concretely, we focused our study on the REDI (Semantic Repository of Ecuadorian Researchers) knowledge base which compiles most of the scholarly assets produced in Ecuador and more specifically on the Computer Science subset of publications. This study found that most of the research topics have shown an steady growth in the volume of publications over time, whereas the Semantic Web and E-Government research topics had a great impact initially and now have been slightly reducing its share in favor of new topics such as Information Integration, Machine Learning and Data Mining.";

The author describes the two quarter credit seminar CSC 4899, Ethical and Social Issues in Computer Science. This single-course approach, especially as a capstone-type course for Seniors, provides an opportunity for students with background in the discipline to apply their technical knowledge-and one hopes the maturity of four years' college experience-to issues they may soon face. The goal of the Ethics and Social Issues in Computer Science Project is two-part. The first is largely completed: finding the intersections and integrating computer ethics topics into the computer science major curriculum. This paper outlines the integration plan. Phase two will be the implementation of the curriculum, with ongoing analysis of its success (and revision as necessary). This phase is due to begin in 1998.";

CS has lost roughly 50% of its majors in the last 5 years. The member institutions have introduced a 3-credit hour course called CS0 that is intended to motivate students, especially those who have a weak background in computing, to continue studies in computing and to prepare students for success in the first CS course. There are two models that are being implemented: one using Alice software and another using Python. CAHSI is creating a repository for support materials for dissemination of each of the implementations";

bibo:abstract "Humans are very efficient in processing and remembering visual information. That is why metaphors and visual representations are important in education. Because of their high visual expressiveness, presentation tools like Microsoft PowerPoint are very popular for teaching in classrooms. However, representing source code with such tools is tedious and cumbersome, while alternatives like source code editors lack visual expression. Moreover, modifying prepared content, e.g. while responding to questions, is not well supported. In this paper, we introduce VisualCues, an approach with the goal of combining the flexibility of source code editors with the visual expressiveness of classical slide-based presentation tools. A key concept of VisualCues is linking visual artifacts to specific elements of source code. The main advantage is that when changing the underlying source code, the positions of linked visual artifacts are changed simultaneously. We implemented a first prototype and evaluated it in two undergraduate computer science courses.";

As CS education is an emerging field, many education stakeholders can be ill-equipped to identify CS PD needs, evaluate options, and assess educator and student outcomes. As a result educators may participate in CS PD that fails to address their needs, which worsens equity gaps in CS education. Therefore, models of evaluating CS PD programs and outcomes are critical to equitable CS education.

Object Orientation, the paradigm Divide and Conquer, and Modularity are only three examples that make use of Part-Whole-Thinking, which is a fundamental skill enabling Life Long Learning. It includes the ability to cognitively (and often subconsciously) identify Part-Whole-Relationships, which help us to understand objects, systems, processes, definitions, and concepts. As part of a two-year Girls' Engineering course held at a Northern-German secondary school it was tried to improve students' overall understanding of Information Technology by including Part-Whole-Thinking into its course content. The way this was done was through the use of littleBits for rapid prototyping of various Internet-of-Things devices. In this short paper, this practical approach is presented and the advantages in explicitly making Part-Whole-Thinking a central topic in class are discussed.";

In response to computing curriculum 1991 many computing programs adopted closed laboratories, especially for early courses. But advances in computing since 1991 raise questions about why closed laboratories should be used. The project has begun with a reexamination of the goals and strengths of the closed laboratory model. We have defined a classification of the types of activities students carry out in closed laboratories, along with set of rationales for why an activity might be included in a closed laboratory. These results were used to modify some closed laboratories in our CS1 course. We believe that the more complete understanding that our analysis of closed laboratories provides will help us design more effective practicum-oriented experiences for students in computing courses.";

bibo:abstract "Many countries have started national curriculum changes to make computer science (CS) as a compulsory subject for all students in schools. In 2018, a new national computing curriculum has been developed in Qatar for all k-12 grades. Comparing to the old curriculum, the new one focuses on teaching computer science instead of digital literacy. This paper discusses the challenges of implementing this new curriculum from CS teachers’ perspectives in Qatar public schools. A survey was conducted of over 392 CS teachers who taught the new curriculum during the academic year 2018/2019. From the analysis of the collected data, it is found that teachers face different challenges including more working loads, lack of support to master the new contents, as well as the need of professional developments to improve their pedagogical skills in order to deliver the new CS concepts effectively. Moreover, the results shows that teachers in preparatory and secondary stages struggle with these challenges more than those in the elementary stage. Although all teachers are computing majors, the majority indicated that programming subjects in all grades are the topics where they need the most support. Accordingly, more support in term of improving teachers’ content knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge is essential in order to achieve the objectives of this reform.";

bibo:abstract "Computer Science contains many abstract concepts, which are both difficult to teach, and to comprehend. Many attempts have been made to help students learn these concepts through visualizations and various teaching techniques; however, these methods are mostly limited to the classroom and do not allow the student time to fully explore the concepts by themselves. By enabling students to interact with the material at their own pace, through an easily accessible and dynamic learning environment, students should be better able to retain and understand the concepts of Computer Science. Binary Search Tree (BST) is an abstract concept which can easily be converted into an interactive format suitable for student self-learning. To see whether an interactive format enhances students learning, a web-based prototype was created. The game consists of forming links between orbs, selecting orbs, copying orbs and removing orbs. This allows for all operations of Binary Search Trees to be explored while presenting the concept in a simple manner. As operations are preformed, and links are made, pseudocode is highlighted in the information menu as a way to reinforce learning and provide context to the operations. In order to measure the effectiveness of the prototype, a pre-survey and a post survey are integrated into the web application.";

bibo:abstract "There is a tradition in introductory computer science courses of assigning homework problems on a variety of topics. The authors suggest that this is not the best way to reach the oft-stated goal of teaching students to become good problem solvers. Indeed, the experience of the average student will probably convince the student that important lessons on topics like encapsulation code reuse, and organization of a solution (through pseudo code, flowcharts, etc.), are irrelevant at best, and quite possibly wasteful. Each assignment is self-contained and, at least in the eye of the student, instantly forgettable. The authors propose that even at an introductory level, connecting assignments into semester-long project has many benefits. This approach makes it easier to introduce concepts one wants students to learn, especially, but not exclusively, with the movement towards teaching object-oriented programming in the first programming course. Students are forced by the assignments to write modular code and encouraged to reuse code (from earlier assignments as well as from standard libraries). The relatively large size and modular nature of the overall program naturally leads to thinking about the problem in a more abstract way. At the same time, this approach should increase interest on the part of the students so that they should be paying attention when presented with important concepts. For their part, instructors are more or less constrained by the format to write assignments that support their own goals. The authors present the case for a project-based approach and report their experience using this approach in the fall semester of 1998, especially as compared with their experiences with the traditional approach. They include comments from students, both those who took the course with the project-based approach and those who took the course with the traditional approach. They note potential problems and explain how they have tried to handle them.";

bibo:abstract "While cloud-and web-based Integrated Development Environments (IDE) are used in practice and education for some time, these are mainly intended for classical web development. Support for enterprise platforms such as Java Enterprise Edition (EE) is typically lacking. However, in higher education, web-based cloud IDE are particularly useful in software development courses for non-computer science major students, since they could help to overcome the participants' limited IT skills. Thus, a respective easy-to-use web IDE is required. Therefore, in this paper a software platform for a web-based cloud IDE for educational purposes is proposed and evaluated, which in particular supports Java EE and is suitable for non-computer science majors. The platform was evaluated in a classroom experiment. The results indicate that it is useful and beneficial for the students, allowing the lecturer and the students to focus more on the actual learning objectives.";

dblp:bibtexType "Conferences";
bibo:abstract "Computer technology changes rapidly, especially in the last decades. IEEE and ACM have developed curriculum recommendations for computer technology in the last 50 years and always add extensions or modify the content to keep the pace with the ongoing changes. Nowadays, five curricula are defined within the Computing Curricula: Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Systems, Information Technology and Software Engineering. Although some of them are updated in a period of 4-5 years, there are examples lasting for quite a long time, such as Computing from 2005 and Computer Engineering curricula from 2004. Still, the latest emerging technologies - Cloud computing, Internet of Things, Internet of Everything, Big Data, Machine to Machine and Human to Machine communications and interaction, software-defined everything, smart cities, high performance scaled computing, etc., raise the challenges if these curricula are ready to cover modern trends. Even more, the real question is whether they should be changed, upgraded or give rise to a new curriculum? This paper analyzes the new emerging trends and technologies and how they are covered in the current curricula that are present at our faculty (Computer Science and Computer Engineering). We present how a track of courses and their syllabuses are adapted towards these new emerging technologies, without changing the whole curriculum. There are multiple results of these changes. Students now can choose a track and learn the courses with increased interest; they can see the \"whole picture\" after finishing all courses of the track; they prepare more complex projects and they are happier with the changes. Finally, several diploma theses emerged that follow the current trends in the computer technology, which prepare the students to be already good engineers on the labor market. We strongly believe that with our new approach, the motivation for learning the hardware-based courses will be returned to the students, which will facilitate the trend of decreasing interest and number of engineering students.";

bibo:abstract "Competitive intelligence analysis commonly is applied for enterprises but when applying to universities or higher education institutions and research contributions, it could lead to know how institutions could preserve and grow in future, even for countries, to consider changes in research and development policies. The objective of this work is to know the trend in academic publications for Iberoamerican countries, obtaining a ranking in the quantity of publication, then analyzing the top of the contributors to identify changes in trends in the academic research contributions trend in the XXI century for engineering and computers sciences. The first part of the study looks for the general contributions per country, including publications, the main areas of knowledge in which each country is centering its talents and resources and the main countries they contribute with, considering all the areas of knowledge from the SCOPUS database. It also includes collaboration and trends in relative positions in time. For the second part, our interest is to know the publications trend in Engineering and Computer Sciences areas of knowledge, which involves Information and Communications Technologies just for the top Iberoamerican countries. As results for the first part, we found three groups, the first one includes those countries which have produced more than 200,000 documents, such as Spain, Brazil, Mexico, Portugal, Argentina, and Chile. Meanwhile the second one includes those countries which have produced less than that, but more than 20,000 such as Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Uruguay and the third group includes other six countries producing less than 20,000 documents in their history. Results in the second part were focused on contributions and trends for engineering and computer sciences, considering just the top 11 countries in the first two groups. Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador members of the second group showed an excellent growth rate, even better that the members of the first group. This curated information will be of high value for policymakers and leaders for the future development of research contributions by different countries to promote specific collaboration in determined areas of knowledge and with specific collaborators.";

This study aims to learn from the perspectives and knowledge of seven women of color who are high school computing teachers. Using ethnographic methods and data collected from professional development observations and interviews, this study examines how the intersectional identities and embodied experiences of these educators can inform efforts at broadening participation in computing for students. The findings of this study point to the importance of not playing it safe, commitment to teaching in historically underserved communities, intersectional identities and impact on teaching, and critical hope as key tenets in these teachers' standpoints towards broadening participation in computing. While some of these tenets can inform other educator's pedagogical efforts at broadening participation in computing, the embodied, gendered, and racialized nature of these findings highlight the need to prepare a diverse teacher cadre as part of building authentic opportunities to learn for all students.";

bibo:abstract "This Work in Progress Research Paper presents a visual analytic workflow to assist instructors of introductory computer science courses to manage their students' learning and success. Sometimes introductory college classes are notoriously called “weed-out” courses, which students who fall behind, are discouraged from continuing the career path. Students with different educational backgrounds may be unnecessarily defeated in these courses. In this work, we identify what class data can be collected and supplied to data analytic tooling to generate insights into monitoring the students' progress. We first investigate a variety of machine learning tools and techniques on a class dataset. Then, we present work-in-progress designs of a visual analytic workflow. Through the interaction with the visual analytic tool, instructors of the introductory computer science course gather insights into the class, for example, “Which part of the programming assignment is causing students to have the most software bugs?”, “Which exam questions best test the understanding of runtime analysis?”, “What type of student activity results in fascinating over 50% of the class to participate and understand the material”?";

As a first result of this analysis high download numbers were found at the time of lectures of different subjects. Many of the students do not visit the presentations of different subjects, which accounts for the bad paper results in this case. As a second result of this analysis the highest number of downloads was found one day before the test or on the test day. This means students are not interested in CS. The situation is similar when looking at other subjects. Students try hard to get a degree without learning.";

Computer science curriculum standards, developed separately by ACM in 1978 (and revised at the introductory level in 1984) and by the IEEE Computer Society in 1983, can play an important role in the accreditation process. The author examines the essentially complementary relationship that must be maintained between these two types of standards. Their different purposes in the broad scope of computer science education are examined. The potential impact of future curriculum standard development on the accreditation standard, and vice-versa, is also explored.<>";

bibo:abstract "In this Innovative Practice work in progress paper, we discuss the convergence of two engineering disciplines (computer and materials sciences) for the co-creation of technology-based learning resources, achieved through trans disciplinary student-staff partnerships. The partnerships are made of producers (computer science students and staff) and clients (materials science students and staff) working together towards the creation of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) interactive simulations that are made by students for students. The student-staff partnership was achieved through a careful balance of roles, knowledge, and experience. We achieved an equal partnership through mixing two very disparate disciplines that share little knowledge through the curriculum. We have observed multi-level benefits through the partnership: the student-producers develop technical and professional skills that allow them to competently address scientific and societal challenges. The student-clients acquire domain expertise needed to advise and guide the producers and manage projects. This is also a unique opportunity for staff since they experience learning from students, and the process during the development and testing of ideas can enhance their teaching practice and open new avenues for curriculum development.";

The program is also required to have suitable feedback mechanisms to assure that the results of the assessment mechanisms are utilized to improve the program. Finally, the program is required to document how the curriculum is related to its objectives and outcomes. Formulating precise objectives and outcomes, implementing suitable assessment instruments to evaluate the achievement of objectives and outcomes, and setting up feedback mechanisms to use the assessment results, are all challenging tasks for most computer science faculty.

bibo:abstract "The hype around the series ”The Queen’s Gambit” led to a boom in playing chess. The game enhances strategic thinking, stimulates intellectual creativity, and improves problem-solving. These skills are increasingly in demand and also essential in the field of computer science (CS). Traditional teaching approaches are often insufficient to teach CS concepts. Interactive and digital experiences can be used to create an exciting, engaging, and realistic learning environment. In this paper, we explore the potential of a chess-based learning approach to increase motivation in CS. The application includes an interactive chess-puzzle simulation to teach the concept of state machines using a chessboard as an input field. We present a study with 35 students for evaluating the students’ motivation, emotions, and workload with a focus on the learning experience. The results indicate a positive impact on the learning process and engage students in learning computer science.";

bibo:abstract "This paper aims to introduce a new efficient system, called eCSCDA, to efficient analyze Computer Science (CS) course description. The primary task of the system is to identify similar (and dissimilar) contents amount two (or a group of) CS course descriptions which can help to know similar and different focuses on important contents to teach to students. Moreover, it can help to check for integrity and quality and to set up a standard of teaching contents of the course. In eCSCDA, text processing procedure is newly rearranged and developed. Besides, the linguistic rules and their derivation are newly updated and applied to extracted important keywords. Moreover, two synonym corpuses, terminology and word synonyms, are recently designed and collected to consider synonyms of the keywords hidden in the course descriptions. Last, to efficiently identify similar contents, two new matching techniques, sub-keyword and semantic matching techniques, are designed and applied together with exact and subset (superset) matching methods. Experiments were conducted on CS course contents gathered from nine Thai Universities to examine the effectiveness of our proposed system in comparison with previous system and related methodologies. From the results, it shows that eCSCDA is efficient to analyze the course contents and outperforms other related systems in various terms e.g. percentage of similar contents, precision, recall and F-measure, respectively.";

While there are obvious factors like the dot com bust that may explain much of our communal enrollment crash over the last few years, anecdotal reports also suggest that the No Child Left Behind act of 2001 (NCLB), and specifically the fact that computer science is not an area that students are tested on, may be a factor in the decreased presence of computer science at the high school level. But how can we empirically separate the effect of the dot com bust from that of NCLB given the proximity in time of the two events? This paper presents a first attempt to do so: recognizing the fact that private schools are exempt from NCLB, it seems appropriate to compare public school students with their private school counterparts. We present some initial results of our investigation focusing on our home state of New Jersey. This paper discusses these results and further directions of study.";

Statistics show that out of the total production of 14.6 million tons of pineapple worldwide, India produces 1.2 million tons during 2013-14, making India the fifth largest producer of pineapple in the world. Pineapple production is higher in the north-eastern states of India, including West Bengal. The total production of pineapple in India in 2013-14 was 1736.74 thousand metric tons, the total production in the different states of Northeast India was 947.19 thousand metric tons, which is more than 50 percent of the total production in these states [1], [2], [3]. Naturally, the commercial importance of pineapple is quite high in the north-eastern states of India. But the lack of precise planning and the lack of concept of using technology in agriculture is an obstacle to mass production of pineapple. Moreover, due to the lack of concept of using technology in diagnosing various diseases of pineapple, its production is greatly hampered [4], [5]. This research paper discusses how computer technology has been used in different countries of the world for increasing the production as well as diagnosing different diseases of pineapple.";

bibo:abstract "This paper describes a collaborative project that was conducted to promote Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) Education among pre-service and in-service teachers as well as Teacher Preparation Faculty. More than 40 pre-service and in-service teachers and 9 Education faculty members from three schools participated in a learning experience designed to address the K-12 Computer Science Framework [1] and Maryland's K-12 Computer Science Standards. The collaboration was designed to develop CS/CT knowledge, understanding, skills and application among participants. In phase one of the project, pre-service and in-service teachers explored CS educational hard/software platforms and used open-source sites such as Sphero Edu, Wonder Workshop, Scratch and Code.org. They envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms, and they worked collaboratively to design a problem-based project for their own students. In phase two of the project, teacher preparation faculty were trained to integrate CS and CT into several preservice courses as well as build into the coursework sequence meaningful experiences that would expose future teachers to CS and CT knowledge and skills so that they could then incorporate these into their own K-8 lesson plans. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge. The feedback from the participants shows positive results.";

This behavior is known as “procrastination”, and it is very common in industrial societies. In the educational context, one of the most likely procrastination situations is the development of a bachelor degree thesis or Master's thesis where the student is supposed to work on an original written work. This paper presents the findings of a survey on typical barriers of the thesis's development, carried out with 51 Computer Science Master's students. The survey measured participants' procrastination using the General Procrastination Scale proposed by Lay and their current situation in the thesis's development. The findings of the survey show that the main barriers to begin the final thesis work are lack of time and motivation. Furthermore, general and descriptive information about the students' current situation was obtained.";

bibo:abstract "Because many computer science students see themselves as future practitioners rather than computer designers, their interest in computer architecture and hardware has been declining over the years. This trend has accelerated with the growth of multimedia, web design and computer games. In this work in progress we argue that computer architecture is still a necessary component of the curriculum. However, if it is to survive, it must change to suit today's courses. Slightly modifying the computer architecture curriculum is no longer an option; the curriculum must be transformed into a tool that serves the interests of students studying the new computing subjects. The focus must move from traditional topics such as number conversion and logic design to topics like data compression, mobile computer technology, ubiquitous computing and even steganography. The proposed course is not intended to replace all conventional computer architecture courses; it is targeted at students on multimedia-oriented courses.";

bibo:abstract "In recent years, with the rapid development of computer simulation CS technology, CS technology has played an increasingly important role in food science(FC), engineering Virtual simulation experimental(VSP) platform design, etc. The current FC and engineering VSP platform lacks an effective platform framework to manage the experimental environment as a whole, and the configuration and evaluation of the experiment are relatively inconvenient. Based on the relevant application research of CS technology, this paper constructs the design of the current FC and engineering VSP platform to meet the needs of the current experimental platform design and application. In the current period of increasing food safety concerns, in this paper, we have conducted extensive research on FC and engineering in designing a simulation experimental platform and created a logical and effective impact assessment metric in a simulated experimental environment. system. The development case for virtualized experiences offers the possibility. The final result of the study shows that when the number of trials of experimental platform four is 76, its corresponding accuracy rate is 98.8%. When the number of trials of experimental platform 5 is 91, its corresponding accuracy rate is 98.2%. The results show that when the number of tests on the experimental platform increases, the corresponding experimental accuracy rate is always maintained at about 98.5%, indicating that the platform has a high and stable accuracy rate, and has feasibility and certain promotion value.";

However, most Computer Science textbooks do not provide sufficient exercises or problems to help students practice what they learn. Without such practice, students tend to have a shallow understanding of the programming constructs, and are inadequately prepared to apply the constructs to solve problems. We may use courseware to address this problem of insufficient exercises and examples in textbooks. A courseware module may be built for each topic, which includes/presents an infinite source of examples as well as problems. We are currently building such courseware modules to teach the semantics of programming language constructs. Although the modules are designed for the C programming language, most of them can be easily generalized to any other language. Each of the courseware modules addresses three pedagogical concerns: analysis, synthesis and testing.";

We introduce a novel solution, the Joint International Master’s in Computer Science program, in which students take courses at two of three partner institutions in United States, Germany, and Australia. In contrast to a traditional study abroad program, the coursework in this program consists largely of technical material within the discipline. It also includes international projects. The result is a unique experience in which students work directly with faculty and students from multiple countries. This gives them both a broader perspective on the discipline and a deeper respect for graduates from other educational systems.

bibo:abstract "Personal development is a lifelong learning process. The process starts from setting up a learning plan, participating in learning activities accordingly, consolidating learning experiences, reflecting on what has been learned and making adjustments to the learning plan. Learning happens anytime and anywhere, from well-structured courses to unstructured activities. However, participation in extracurricular activities is not structured and difficult to be used for planning and reflection. We, therefore, developed a method with a repository to record student participation in extracurricular activities, to link such data to intended learning outcomes. By analyzing the data of a group of computer science students, we found a positive correlation between the level of participation in extracurricular activities and academic performance. This can potentially provide a personalized professional development scheme for computer science students for better planning and tracking of their learning through the participation in extracurricular activities.";

bibo:abstract "Summary form only given. This paper presents the University Class Scheduling Model specifically designed for the Computer Science department at Portland State University (USA). The approach taken with this paper uses genetic algorithms employing Ward System's GeneHunter with Excel for the PC as the target platform. Excel was selected so that non-programmers could easily modify and expand the model as the needs of the curriculum changes. The paper introduces the genetic model developed to automate this process. Once the theory behind the model's framework is presented, the paper then steps through each of the inputs, results, and constraints required to develop recommended and feasible schedules. This includes constraints for matching faculty to courses, for selecting the day and time a course is offered, for blocking faculty availability so they will not be assigned more than once for a given day and time, and for offering sections specifically in the evening. Each constraint is described in terms of its functionality and is also formulated mathematically. A total of over 600 hours of test suites were executed and evaluated to determine the model's viability.";

There are strong indications that a creative approach in programming allows to pay attention to institutional and social requirements concerning computer science education. This includes the students' interest and motivation as well as their performance and knowledge acquisition. Even though, this has been discussed before, this paper presents a first basic structure of a didactic concept, enabling an integration of creative coding as an additional path for teaching computer science in schools in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Taking existing approaches into account, basic ideas of creative coding are identified and connected to the concepts of Computational Thinking.";

In response, we are developing a curriculum-independent course format designed to develop the ability of students to write, speak, and argue effectively to a broad audience. This format includes an evaluative process in which students absorb and respond to technical readings within an existing curriculum and a highly literate technical project guided by several milestones";

bibo:abstract "Computer science including data analytics is a widely popular field, boasting promising career opportunities in the future. Proficiency in programming stands as a fundamental requirement for success in this domain. However, students entering MSc programs in data analytics often possess varying levels of programming background, which can impact their performance in assignments. Recognising and addressing these differences through tailored instruction can improve students’ outcomes. This paper explores the importance of considering students' programming backgrounds in the data analytics field and highlights strategies to enhance their performance based on prior knowledge. This study was carried out on two different modules in two different pathways. We have chosen two distinct cohorts and pathways to ensure unbiased conclusions in our study. The initial research was applied to the Database and Programming Fundamentals module for an MSc data analytics cohort, and then we utilized a Deep Learning module for final year computer science undergraduates as a validation cohort. As a conclusion, this study successfully demonstrated a significant increase in student assignment performance through the implementation of tailored instruction based on students' programming backgrounds. Despite receiving positive student feedback and observing excellent and improved performances, it is crucial to acknowledge instances of unsatisfactory student performance as well. Both studies were conducted by the School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science (EEECS) at Queen's University Belfast (QUB) during the academic year 2021/2022.";

bibo:abstract "Methods of instruction for many undergraduate courses in database systems and design still focus primarily an lectures and a single, all-encompassing design project to reinforce database concepts. This paper describes how the database systems course taught at the US Military Academy has evolved to include immediate concept reinforcement in the classroom using networked PCs and a graphically-oriented relational database and application development software tool for each cadet. Heretofore, many relational database concepts were discussed in theory and not thoroughly demonstrated. Our course incorporates immediate concept demonstration using running courseware examples that graphically illustrate practical application of the underlying theory. These examples, for instance, allow direct mapping from theoretical discussions of relational algebra to SQL implementation and finally to query-by-example construction. The traditional course culminated in a final project of limited practical use. This delayed mastery of the theory until completion of the course project, still leaving students without a meaningful product to show for their efforts. With direct application of the theory in our course, understanding is immediate. This allows successful integration of an early project of equal magnitude to the usual final design project. Later, a capstone design project is permitted, emphasizing group interaction with a real-world client and team development of a viable, stand-alone database application. To conclude the course, groups orally present their product in class and write a technical report supporting their work.";

At Shippensburg University, only 7% of computer science undergraduate majors are female. Recently, they have banded together to form a Women in Computer Science (WiCS) organization with a unique mission. They started by researching why they are such a small minority. Our students feel a strong need to change the misperceptions that deter girls and are addressing them with a new video podcast that is targeted at girls in secondary school and designed to connect computer science topics to current issues. We are building a website around these podcasts in the hopes of creating an on-line community connecting our students to girls in secondary schools. This project has done an excellent job of creating a community for our female students clearly helping retain the few women we have. We are hoping that it will improve our recruitment of women and encourage girls to pursue computer science even if they enroll elsewhere.";

They believe that this pedagogical shift has, by far, the highest leverage for improving computer science education. To achieve this goal, they have based the core sequence of their curriculum at the University of Virginia on a series of closed laboratory activities. The lecture content and materials will be supportive of the laboratories rather than the other way around. The authors began development of the first course (ICS: Introduction to Computer Science) of their new curriculum during Spring '92 and offered it in both the Fall '92 and Spring '93 semester. They present a brief overview of course content, course evaluation, and operational problems of the laboratory experience.<>";

Dr. Anjum led the camp--- consisting of 5 highly interactive training sessions--- to introduce various exciting computing concepts to the students. The sessions were conducted with the help of the school's STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics) faculty and included videos, active discussion, and hands-on activities introducing new skills. This effort was aimed to inspire young people to step up and contribute to the future of technology. In this paper, the authors share some of the lessons and insights gained from this experience. They also discuss those strategies that worked and those that didn't while sharing some recommendations for students and faculty interested in conducting such outreach.";

We examine FluoRender’s script system to demonstrate its translation process. In this article, we borrow the concept of lingua franca from linguistics. We designed a connecting language between the source and target domains for translation, thereby augmenting understanding and acceptance. In FluoRender’s script system, the lingua franca consists of the mapping between the control of the media player and the computational and interactive subroutines of an analysis workflow. Workflows supporting automatic, semiautomatic, and manual operations were made available and easily accessible to end users. The formalization of the lingua franca as a technique for translational computer science provides guidance for future development.";

bibo:abstract "An ad-hoc creation of situations where interconnected and movable devices, often empowered with computational capabilities, create instances of Internet-of-Everything, (IoE) has become common. The examples range from autonomous vehicles on our roads and unmanned movable objects, designed for a variety of tasks, to internet of biomedical devices, wearable robotics and digital therapeutics. In all these examples, we create computational models and solutions, which enable inter-operation between devices, and secure the accomplishment of various tasks. However, computational models in such environments are highly influenced by physical devices, which either generate data and feed our computations, or perform \"action(s)\" according to results of computing. Computations and devices do not exist in isolation; they are interwoven and influence each other, even if we see them as belonging to two different worlds. Design decision and manufacturing of a device may have implications on types of computing we could perform with them, and thus affect the performance of an instance of IoE, as a cyber-physical space. The same is true for software abstractions and models. We expect that data should be available or delivered by devices, and computations should be accommodated by at least partially, if not completely by these devices. In this study, we illustrate the interference or an impact of engineering practices and design of wearable devices, including wearable robotics, with/on computational power these devices may or should have. We debate the way of enhancing the both: device manufacturing and creation of software where these wearable devices perform a crucial role. The purpose of this study is to open discussions towards intelligent engineering, where the purpose and usefulness of devices are jointly decided, during their design, by both engineers and computer scientists. By understanding the impact of engineering design decisions to potential computational power of cyber physical spaces, such as IoE, we should be able to create more efficient operational IoE, which will be more manageable and might meet our expectations.";

An experimental study with two groups of students totaling 38, investigated the effect of using static graphics and text over dynamic visuals with the same amount of text. For the study, two versions of a computer-based learning on a computer science subject, for the topic of memory management in operating systems were developed and served as a learning material. To test on the effectiveness, students were given a test on recall and transfer of knowledge after studying the learning material. Initial analysis of results indicates no statistical difference between the scores for the two versions and suggests that dynamic visuals, by themselves, do not necessarily improve student understanding.";

bibo:abstract "While many computer science (CS) curricula are increasingly addressing a demand for more communicative and ethical graduates, reports of CS student difficulties with nontechnical subjects, such as Professional Ethics, persist. These seem compounded for students learning through a second or foreign language. This paper explores the impact that multimodal engagement interfaces can have on content comprehension. 30 participants of varying English language ability were asked to engage with four unrelated articles under four different conditions: baseline reading (C1); guided reading (sentence-by-sentence) (C2); audio/listening only (C3); and concurrent (multi-modal) presentation of C2 & C3 (C4). After each engagement, participants were asked to complete a comprehension test on the material that they had just encountered. A subjective survey evaluating the “comfort” and “engagement quality” of each interface was also completed after each interaction. Our results paint a complex picture with the guided reading interface (C2) producing both the best performance, and the poorest subjective evaluation from participants. This result aligns with existing findings identified in the field of reading education. The results highlight how varying language levels in participants impact subjective and performance metrics, suggesting how future interfaces may better support readers, according to their language ability or intended outcomes of reading.";

The promotion of scientific research and innovation ability is related to the development of economy and society. Scientific research performance evaluation is based on the improvement of scientific research, as well as the development of scientific research activities. By computer science, we can assure its proficiency. It aims to actively promote the initiative of scientific research, and improve the efficiency of scientific research management. Scientific research and innovation ability are different to an extent. Traditionally, scientific research evaluation is based on the level of project leaders, personnel composition, the number of projects obtained or the level of achievements, which are not that appropriate nor scientific. Therefore, based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the scientific research by computer, this paper focuses on exploring scientific research performance evaluation by computer science. With the premise of clarifying the scientific research innovation ability, innovation composition, innovation goal and innovation significance, this paper will explore the strategies and methods by computer, to enhance scientific research innovation ability of colleges and universities, so as to give a reference to colleges and universities.";

bibo:abstract "Traditional M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs are being supplemented by \"fourth-level\", integrated Ph.D. programs which seek to formalise the transition from undergraduate to postgraduate study. As well as undertaking formal modules, graduate students on these programs are expected to quickly learn how to plan, manage and conduct research. They should also know how to present the outcomes of their research in peer- reviewed publications. Moreover, they must be able to reflect critically on existing research as well as on their own findings. In the development of one such integrated Ph.D. program it was found that there is little agreement on the constituent elements of a module on computing research methods or on the pedagogical principles to be employed in the preparation and delivery of such a module. This paper reports on the design, experience and assessment of a graduate level module on research methods in computer science, documenting how it was planned and realised, reporting on the staff and student experiences, and providing both objective and subjective assessments of the module and its outcomes.";

The idea is to have a simple environment that could improve peer learning, collaboration and information sharing among the participants. Students could take advantage of the produced and collected information in their learning portfolios and lecturers might use some parts of the information to develop their teaching. The results show that Wiki platform is applicable to even less experienced students, but it requires guidance and effort to motivate the students to provide own content.";

bibo:abstract "Intracortical brain-computer interfaces hold the potential to improve the quality of life for patients living with motor control disorders. However, a critical barrier to the successful clinical translation of these devices is recording instability, which, if unmitigated, can quickly cause control to deteriorate. Recent findings have indicated that high-dimensional neural population activity resides in a low-dimensional “neural manifold”. Here I will introduce the concept of neural manifolds and briefly recap recent findings showing that neural manifolds constrain the types of brain-computer interface mappings that can be easily learned. Finally, I will show how these neural manifolds can be leveraged to mitigate the effects of neural recording instability, enabling stable control in the presence of even severe recording instabilities.";

Most efforts to broaden participation in computer science lack a cultural and contextual perspective, and focus on building individual competencies and motivation. In this paper, we propose that a greater understanding of relationships is critical to inform efforts to increase the interest and build the computational skills of Latino/a youth to enter and persist in a computing education pathway. The focus of this study is on a community technology center that serves primarily Latino/a youth in an agricultural region of California. The primary research question was “What is the role of relationships in Latino/a students' interest in computer science?” Data were collected from high school students (97 surveys and 20 in-depth interviews), and from center staff (6 in-depth interviews). The findings show how relationships help students connect computer science to cultural values by forming communities of practice around CS with similar peers and mentors.";

The visual labs are developed using a visual programming toolkit. They employ a build-and-test paradigm. Each lab permits the user to construct a graph by assembling and linking icons, and then to execute the graph. The user need not be aware of constructing a program, but can focus on creating a model (of a mobile robot or a component of a CPU, for instance), and then observe the behavior of that model. The labs have proven successful in CS survey courses and in an upper-level robotics course.<>";

bibo:abstract "WIP Research Paper: The ability to identify threshold concepts within a discipline recognizes key components within a curriculum which, when learned, enables an individual to demonstrate as a member of that community. Within computer science, potential threshold concepts have sparked debates among researchers. According to the original definition by Meyer and Land, threshold concepts result in an individual being placed into a state of uncertainty or liminality and successful traversal of this liminal state results in a potentially irreversible transformation. When seeking to identify threshold concept, researchers often search for what concepts students feel are ‘troublesome’ or ‘difficult to learn’ since this state is often difficult to describe or understand when currently inside it or just past it. While threshold concepts have been identified for the beginning stages of programming, there is little to no work on the intermediate years of university computing education (years 2 & 3) and what potential threshold concepts exist during that time for computer science students. Our goal with this research is to help address this gap by answering the following research question: What concepts do intermediate students identify as being troublesome and/or ‘uncomfortable to learn’ within their computer science coursework?";

bibo:abstract "Arkansas Tech University (ATU) has over 650 students (2020–2021) from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) majors taking programming sequence (PS) courses each semester. However, despite minor efforts to increase retention, the Engineering and Computing Sciences Department has had difficulty retaining students in the PS courses. The Programming Sequence Improvement Program (PSIP) has been implemented to address this issue. Its goal is to improve retention and student success in three PS courses: Foundations of Computer Programming I (COMS 2104), Foundations of Computer Programming II (COMS 2203), and Data Structures (COMS 2213). The PSIP aims to reduce the rate of D, F, Withdraw, and Incomplete (DFWI) grades by 10% annually from the current average baseline of 32%, 35%, and 27%, respectively (2015–2019). This program aims to revolutionize the Programming Sequence (PS) curriculum within the initial two years of study, fostering increased knowledge and improving overall degree completion rates. To achieve this goal, the PS Improvement Program (PSIP) employs four distinct approaches: establishing a dedicated tutoring lab for students enrolled in programming courses, integrating effective communication and collaboration tools like Discord and WebEx, conducting research on contemporary pedagogies for programming instruction, and aligning the curriculum with prominent platforms such as GitHub, Hacker Rank, and LeetCode. By implementing these strategies, the PSIP creates a transformative learning environment that enhances students' programming skills and facilitates their success in the program.";

The application was developed in Unity, considering five concordant themes in the curricula of both universities (linear, non-linear, recursion, sorting, and search). The objective was to analyze the incorporation of the educational resource. For this, three instruments were used: (1) to examine the students' knowledge level about the subject before and after the resource intervention, (2) a rubric to understand their perception of the quality of mobile educational applications, and (3) the technology acceptance model, which allowed identifying attitudes towards the information technology system based on two previously established variables: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.

bibo:abstract "Current package inserts for medicines are confusing for many patients and can lead to non-compliance. To combat this problem, a readability assistance system has been designed to analyze and improve leaflets to reduce the risks for patients, such as incorrect use of medication. This assistance system is divided into 5 levels: pharmaceutical readability index, graphical package insert leaflet overview, paragraph analysis, sentence analysis and recommendation of sentence rearrangement. The assistance system is designed only as a guide for the person in charge of the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) to guard against possible misunderstanding of the PIL. The final decision is always with the person in charge for the correctness of the wording. In the future it is planned to adapt the assistance system to other types of leaflets.";

This case study utilizes two different versions of multimedia application, each one differing from the other in the type of animation. A total of 73 students took part in this experiment. Across the two studies, we used two types of tests; recall and transfer of knowledge to evaluate student understanding on a particular topic. Early results indicate that multimedia application with 3-D animations do not have significant impact on student recall and transfer of knowledge as compared to 2-D version of animated learning.";

In this paper, we propose an innovative and novel conceptualization of scholarly plagiarism in the form of reuse of explicit citation sentences in scientific research articles. Note that while full-text plagiarism is an indicator of a gross-level behavior, copying of citation sentences is a more nuanced micro-scale phenomenon observed even for well-known researchers. The current work poses several interesting questions and attempts to answer them by empirically investigating a large bibliographic text dataset from computer science containing millions of lines of citation sentences. In particular, we report evidences of massive copying behavior. We also present several striking real examples throughout the paper to showcase widespread adoption of this undesirable practice. In contrast to the popular perception, we find that copying tendency increases as an author matures. The copying behavior is reported to exist in all fields of computer science; however, the theoretical fields indicate more copying than the applied fields.";

Novak Understanding the processes that takes place inside the human mind-while it is thinking and learning-has remained an elusive exercise mostly because of lack of powerful research tools and techniques. Now because of recent advances in various branches of science dealing with mind and brain, it has become possible to better understand the processes of thinking and learning, and the capacity to create new knowledge. For example research from cognitive psychology has considerably increased our understanding of the principles of knowledge organization that govern people's abilities to learn, understand and create new knowledge. It is perhaps the right time to apply these developments in the study of learning to help people to think and read critically, to express themselves clearly and persuasively, and to solve complex problems. In this tutorial we would first be studying and then applying tools and techniques of science of learning to determine which problems are hard to understand in the field of Theoretical Computer Science. We shall also try to find why a problem is hard and why most of the learners fail to solve it in spite of the fact that they have all the prerequisite knowledge as well as the motivation to do it.";

bibo:abstract "Logic Programming allows for the exploration and development of Computational Thinking skills. Those being abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, and generalisation, among others, which are fundamental for problem-solving. What is more, Logic Programming helps building up Logical Thinking skills, also distinguishing valid arguments from fallacies and contradictions, as well as establishing connections between arguments through reasoning, to name some. These practices are not only essential for the development of knowledge in STEM, but also in Computer Science disciplines. Recently, arguments have been standing in favour of the early integration of programming within compulsory education. The international scientific community is looking forward to researching and initiatives being deployed towards this direction. This article introduces Metagame -Metajuego-, a methodological proposal which integrates key aspects to facilitate the effective integration of Logic Programming in primary education through collaborative and gamifying strategies. Furthermore, concrete cases of games are presented which have been formulated thanks to applying the proposed methodological approach to different educational contexts. The narratives upon which these games are based, incorporate learning cores presented in the curricular school designs where they were implemented.";

This project implements a Moodle plugin that performs facial recognition on the student attempting to take a quiz. It consists of two parts for authentication through a webcam: the first part occurs before accessing the quiz, and the second part involves surveillance through a camera during the quiz. The plugin was developed using the PHP and JavaScript programming languages, as well as Face-api. The JavaScript API detects and recognizes faces in the web browser using Tiny Yolo v2 and FaceRecognizerNet. It compares a student’s photo or image with the image from their webcam while they are taking the quiz. The Moodle plugin achieved an average error probability of 39.39% for face detection similarity distance.";

bibo:abstract "The Computer Science Department at Jackson State University (JSU) is updating its curriculum according to the new ABET guidelines. As part of this effort, the computer science faculty members have integrated modules of the NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on PDC (Parallel and Distributed Computing) into department-wide core and elective courses offered on fall 2014. These courses are: csc 119 Object Oriented Programming (core), csc 216 Computer Architecture and Organization (core), csc 312 Advanced Computer Architecture (elective), csc 325 Operating Systems (core), csc 350 Organization of Programming Languages (core) and csc 425 Parallel Computing (elective). The inclusion of the PDC modules was gradual and light weighted in the low level courses and more aggressive in the high level courses. Csc 119 Object Oriented Programming provided students with an early introduction to Java Threads: how to create and use. In csc 216 Computer Architecture and Organization students learned about GPUs and were asked to write simple problems using CUDA. Csc 312 Advanced Computer Architecture covered Instruction level and Processor level Parallelism. For csc 325 Operating Systems, mutual exclusion problems and Parallel Computing and Algorithms were introduced. In csc 350 Organization of Programming Languages, students learned about the implementation of threads in Java. Csc 425 Parallel Computing is an advanced study of parallel computing hardware and software issues. Assessment results showed that student perception of PDC concepts was satisfactory with some weakness in writing parallel code. However, students were very excited and motivated to learn about PDC. We were also able to share our experience with the Computer Engineering Department at JSU. New PDC modules will be integrated into some of their courses next fall and spring semesters. Our findings were made available on the Center for Parallel and Distributed Computing Curriculum Development and Educational Resources (CDER) website. In this paper, we will describe our experience of incorporating PDC modules into the aforementioned computer science courses at JSU.";

bibo:abstract "This innovative practice WIP aims to analyze students' practice behavior and its impacts on students' performance and retention. Studies have shown that memories weaken over time, and the most significant drop in retention happens just a day after you learn something new. Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve suggests that people tend to forget newly learned materials in days or weeks when there is no attempt to review the learned materials. To prevent forgetting, we need to reinforce what we learn by using techniques such as spaced retrieval practice and interleaving. We did that in an Introductory Computer Science Course (CS1). We used quizzes as low-stakes retrieval practice activities (RPAs) that students could take as many times as they want during the semester, along with the U-Behavior teaching and learning method. The U-Behavior method is composed of an application that generates personalized visualizations of student's study behaviors and self-reflections to help students improve their study behaviors to reinforce long-term learning. In a previous study, with data from a Fall 2021 CS1 course, we found a statistically significant increase in final exam scores, final coding exam, and final course grades for students who practice desirable behaviors, spacing and mixing their practice over the semester, compared with students who did not. This study presents a work in progress that uses data from Fall 2023 CS1 course to analyze if the increase in grades persists in a different cohort of students for the same course as well as to extend the previous study by monitoring students practice behaviors in a subsequent class, CS2, that is being taught this Spring 2024 semester. Of 94 students registered in CS1 Fall 2023, a total of 56 consented to participate in the study. Of the 56 students, 18 demonstrated desirable behaviors by spacing and interleaving their practice during the semester, and 38 did not. Initial analysis of Fall 2023 CS1 data showed a statistically significant increase on final exam and final course grades for students who practice desirable study behaviors. Contrary to Fall 2021 CS1 data, no statistical significance was found regarding final coding exam grades for Fall 2023 CS1 students between students who practice desirable behaviors and those who didn't. We analyzed if students who demonstrated desirable practice behaviors are continuing practice in a spaced and interleaved in the subsequent class, CS2. Initial findings and future directions are presented.";

bibo:abstract "Summary form only given. Rice University's introductory course emphasizes design principles. It starts with the simple observation that programs are \"boxes\" that consume and produce data. Since nothing else is known, an engineer must systematically study the collections of consumed and produced data. The course teaches students how to describe collections of data (first in English and SCHEME, then in JAVA) and then how to construct programs systematically using these descriptions. Over the course of a semester, students get to know half a dozen different construction methods of this kind. After they are acquainted with these design methods, they understand that program development means to choose a design method carefully and to communicate the chosen method through the program design to future program readers and modifiers. The course relies on a small subset of SCHEME; at strategic points during the semester, students are also shown how the design methods apply to the development of JAVA programs. For the first six weeks, the course introduces only absolutely necessary features: function definition and application, conditional expressions, and records. At the end of this initial segment, students comfortably program with various forms of lists, trees, and graphs. The last third of the course introduces the basic elements of computer architecture and low-level languages (machine, assembly and C).";

The project is called ROMEO, which is a German acronym for 'robots and people: an occlusion'. The subject selected for the project is a version of the classic hand-eye problem of robotics: given a disassembled 3-D puzzle under the observation area of a small TV camera, the system to be implemented must identify the parts and determine their reference coordinates, as well as the degree of 2-D or 3-D rotations, and control a robot arm to assemble the puzzle. A term-by-term outline of ROMEO is given including both the material presented to the students, their organization into working groups, and results.<>";

bibo:abstract "The goal of this project is to use mathematical principles to show how a ‘magic’ card trick works. The card trick involves a specific number of cards transitioning between a deck and being laid out in a grid-like format. It then utilizes a set of repeated steps to move the spectator's card to the middle of the deck, so the performer can reveal the center card to the audience. The paper uses similar math-based ideas to further provide a generalization for the trick, proving that it should work for any amount of cards, given some restricting guidelines. Using the card trick as a basis, the project further expands on concepts inspired by the trick for more practical applications, such as how it can be be used in fields like computer science, such as performing operations such as sorting and transitioning arrays between one and two dimensions, similar to the process in the card trick. This can show that even using simple, ordinary things like a card trick can result in new possibilities for more advanced topics, which can be useful in areas such as those in STEM.";

bibo:abstract "This work-in-progress innovative practice paper presents an interactive visual map tool called 1 GenSuccess, designed for first-generation computer science students. First-generation college students are students whose parents or guardians have not attended college or earned a college degree. In the United States, first-generation students account for over 40% of first-year college students, making them a significant demo-graphic in the engineering and computing educational field. How-ever, due to a lack of parental familiarity with higher education, limited understanding of the college admissions process, finan-cial constraints, internships, and the challenges associated with engineering and computing coursework, first-generation students in the field of engineering and computing frequently encounter distinctive obstacles across academic, finance, career, cultural, and social dimensions. Recognizing the difficulties these students face, this paper introduces 1 GenSuccess, a novel roadmap web application developed specifically for first-generation college stu-dents in the engineering and computing fields. While numerous web sites currently offer a range of valuable resources to support first-generation college students, a significant gap persists-a lack of a personalized roadmap explicitly crafted to meet the distinct needs and challenges they experience on their computer science educational journey. The primary goal of 1 GenSucccess is to empower engineering students and facilitate their navigation through academia through a visual roadmap. In addition, by presenting a comprehensive suite of resources, support materials, and a personalized roadmap, 1 GenSuccess aims to bridge the gaps in access and information that often impede the progress of first-generation college students in the computer science field.";

I analysed how effectively can students of different grades answer questions dealing with different subjects. From different towns of Hungary over 60 teachers used the test to see the knowledge level of more than 3000 students having answered these questions and from Romania more than 1000. After the evaluation of the test results the correctness of the original presumption emerged. Significance level was 5% through the analysis. Significant divergence by Hungarian students and Romanian students at classical side was found in 10th and 12th grades too. The Hungarian students achieved better results in the 10th grade except for spreadsheet calculation in which the Romanian students turned out to be more successful. In the 12th grade the Romanian students achieved better results at database management; the Hungarian ones reached higher scores in spreadsheet calculation. The Hungarian students performed better at theoretical knowledge and word processing in both grades. For programming the Romanian students attending a science course and a Mathematics-Informatics course reached higher scores than the Hungarian students specialized in Informatics in the 11th grade. The Romanian students attending a natural science course received the same scores the Hungarian students specialized in Informatics and those attending a Mathematics-Informatics course even overtook the Hungarian students in the 12th grade.";

In this paper, we introduce the S-Index, a novel metric designed to evaluate computer science conferences. Additionally, we present the S-i-Index and its visual representation, the S-i-Index diagram, which offer further insights into conference assessment. To facilitate clustering and analyze the relationships between various conferences, we have also developed the S-Index graph. This graph aids in understanding the connections and similarities among conferences.Moreover, the S-Index can identify key researchers associated with each conference, whom we propose as the \"important people\" of that conference. These individuals are instrumental in shaping the conference’s reputation and impact.Our study presents insights, observations, and analytical perspectives on the classification and ranking of conferences using the S-Index, S-i-Index diagram, and S-Index graph. These tools provide essential information that guides researchers in making informed decisions about conference submissions, specifically for non-experts in a specific field.";

Although there are many initiatives going on, still continues the presence of a notable absence of women in the field. Many of the papers analyze the reasons behind this phenomenon and give recommendations on how to increase the participation of women in computer science. The participation in some papers represents the gender gap in the number of students, in other the number of graduates or number of employees.The study presented in this paper includes a review of the research papers that tackle the issue of gender gap in computer science from various perspectives. It includes a concrete investigation of the gender gap based on the research publications by exploring the DBLP. We show the methodology for gathering these papers from the DBLP database, including their authors. The gained results are analyzed and presented, showing the gender distribution among the authors, through years and in different categories.";

bibo:abstract "This work in progress research paper describes a pilot study using a Large Language Model (LLM) Generative Pre-Trained Transformer-based (GPT) system that generates industry-style code reviews for student feedback on software development projects in Computer Science 2nd, 3rd, and 4th+ semester classes (CS2, CS3, CS4+) at an ABET accredited baccalaureate institution. Code reviews are a valuable, but work-intensive, component of the software engineering process and provide important training to undergraduate students in the form of mentor-peer knowledge transfer. Participants in this study engaged in iterative experiential learning using the Automatic Review Tool (ART), an artificial intelligence tool to support software engineering as an Automatic Static Analysis Tool in the Continuous Integration pipeline alongside software testing harnesses and code style checkers. This pilot study was based on earlier results from a full computer science second semester (CS2) class $(\\mathrm{n}=74)$ to develop an ART-generated code review intervention pilot study with a small group of students in CS2 / 3 and CS4. The project underway uses an experiential learning and iterative feedback process to answer research questions including “Does ART provide accurate and actionable code reviews for students” and “Which levels of students are best prepared to receive and use ART-based code reviews?” During this pilot study, the project used a mixed methods research approach with a series of surveys, code review interventions, and numerical analysis of the code reviews' accuracy. Results showed a reasonable degree of code review accuracy by ART and the students learned code review skills from interaction with the ART-based reviews they received. Ongoing work includes increasing the scale of data collection, using this work to refine and focus the ART-based reviews onto the categories of feedback that students find the most valuable, and building out a more modular tool for wider release in the academic community.";

bibo:abstract "Summary form only given. Computer assisted detection (CAD) is a rapidly growing field with applications in a growing number of diseases, modalities, and anatomies. Academic and industrial research groups worldwide are proposing and publishing new approaches, techniques, and paradigms at an ever-increasing rate: The results are encouraging and imply the potential for dramatic improvements in disease detection and tracking. To researchers, it often seems curious that commercialization of these advances lags far behind academic progress, but there are many obstacles to be overcome, from IP management to QSR (quality systems regulations) compliance, from image data and truth collection to GCP (good clinical practices), from bio-statistics to proof of safety & effectiveness with regulatory agencies. This two-hour session is designed to shed light on experiences in CAD commercialization of innovative CAD technologies into the marketplace. The goal is to share best practices, non-competitive ideas, and \"mistakes not to be repeated\" among the seminar participants and with researchers in industry and academia. All speakers are involved in bringing a variety of CAD applications to market.";

bibo:abstract "Research in Bare Machine Computing has experienced significant changes over the years. As a result of the recent events of the pandemic and the need for remote learning, the Bare Machine Internet (BMI) as part of the Bare Machine Computing (BMC) paradigm experienced further studies. This research created tools to examine the internals of the protocols, memory, and scripts as a BMI became feasible. With the increased visualization in teaching Computer Science and remote learning, these features created with the BMI were considered efficacious in Computer Science Education (CSE) BMC/BMI is used in programming applications to run directly on a device. The paradigm is software that runs directly against the hardware using CPU, Memory, and I/O. The software application runs without an Operating System and resident mass storage. An essential part of the BMC paradigm is the Bare Machine Internet. It utilizes an Application Development model software that interfaces directly with the network and file servers' hardware. Because it is “bare,” it is a powerful teaching and research tool that can readily display the internals of the network protocols, software, and hardware of the applications running on the Bare Server. The research demonstrated that the bare server was accessible by laptop and smartphone/android. The purpose was to show the further practicality of Bare Internet in Computer Engineering and Computer Science Education and Research. It also showed that an undergraduate student could use a bare server with any device and browser at any release version connected to the internet. This paper presents the Bare Web Server as an educational tool. We will discuss possible applications of this paradigm.";

bibo:abstract "Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams play an important role in the field of engineering, especially software development, due to their advantages such as accuracy and bridging the gap between documentation and code. However, there are different issues related to the field of specification, some of those issues are maintainability between code and documentation and efficiency of the UML models looking from the side of the developers. This paper describes a quick introspective between the differences of specific student groups, future software engineers, which worked with different UML diagrams and another group working without such diagrams. The analysis looks at the time, correctness of the code and understanding of the project from designing phase to developing phase. In the field of software engineering, UML diagrams play a vital role in designing, analyzing, and documenting software systems. Among the distinct types of UML diagrams, class diagrams stand out as a fundamental tool for representing the structure and behavior of a software application. This work aims to provide a concise overview of class diagrams and their significance in the implementation phase of software development.";

bibo:abstract "The rapid expansion of online higher education, particularly in computer science, has highlighted a significant gap in research opportunities for online learners. There are students in online higher education who have the willingness, availability, and experience to make progress towards research publications but do not have easily accessible research opportunities. Institutions offering online education must address this gap to enhance educational experiences for online students. By creating a pilot study for the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program, a novel marketplace model for research in online higher education is proposed. Key components of the model include research contracts between external collaborators and student researchers - facilitated by a project manager, a procedure for assessments, a resource management system for volunteer and computational requirements, an organized code base with contributions tracking, and community events to foster knowledge sharing and networking. Students were assessed based on progress towards research output and collaborative efforts, including weekly code contributions, weekly reports, and scholarly activities. This framework provides a scalable and generalizable solution for researchers and educators in online learning environments, particularly in an online MOOC setting, and has the potential to significantly impact online higher education in computer science.";

This is done with the aim of validating claims made by the local media about a large deficit of professionals for ICT occupations in this country. On the supply side, we find an increase in the number of university graduates in computer sciences, which is greater than the increase in the total number of academic degrees granted. On the demand side, we find that the expected demand-using the available data-does not seem to largely exceed the supply, apparently contradicting the existence of a large deficit. However, limitations in the data obtained, as well as methodological problems for measuring the gap between supply and demand, might be affecting these results. These limitations are discussed and solutions to overcome them are presented.";

This research is an exploratory case study within the Computer Science Department at the University of Huddersfield, UK. The research focuses to develop a model to explore undergraduate CS student motivation factors through Self-Determination Theory and train the identified factors using learning analytics records. The identified factors will contribute to enhance the student academic achievement and their engagement with the course. In addition, the factors can be used to assist the future designer of learning analytics (LA) tools to adapt the human center design approach. Therefore, the new LA tools can incorporate cognitive and noncognitive factors that can enhance student retention rate and engagement toward computer science department. The study adapts a mixed-method approach using survey, interview and learning analytics records. More than 10,000 thousand virtual learning environment records were analyzed from the year 2018 to 2021. The analysis findings revealed that there are 8 significant factors that can have an impact on CS student engagement and therefore affecting their final grade.";

In this study we considered those course of computer science that involve the processes of software development and analysis. It has been found that XP in full practic is vulnerable against a single course of software engineering, so some of its practices should be incorporated in the first semester of computer science curriculum and rest should be incorporated in later years. We start our work from the introductory course in computer science where we first implement the concept of pair programming and then implement other practices. Some suggestions are included in this work that will be helpful in implementing this methodology.";

Our research proposes a method to distinguish between fake and genuine scientific abstracts in the field of computer science using a specialized dataset and deep learning models. The proposed detection model can differentiate between real and fake abstracts with 97.5% accuracy.

It has subsequently been enhanced based on the feedback of the users. The software has only started to be used by some Design faculty and students this year. Our experience from its use within this Department has revealed the need for redesigning its interface. Both students and faculty have expressed some negative views with regards to the screen layouts, menus, icons, colours, textual representations and fonts used. Based on this feedback, we have redesigned the interface taking also into consideration feedback obtained during the redesign stages from some Design faculty members and Design students.

bibo:abstract "Introduction to Computer Science (ICS) is a compulsory course for freshmen of the electrical engineering (EE) department at our institute, which lays the foundation for more advanced courses. To arouse the interest and learning initiative of students, an optional “Special Practical Experiment in Computer Science (SPECS)” practice was introduced in 2010, emphasizing the integration of concepts with hands-on practice. Questionnaires on teacher evaluation were given to students nearing the end of the ICS course to evaluate their satisfaction with the teaching and their perception of the benefits derived from ICS. Participants and non-participants of SPECS were compared according to their post-SPECS class attendance and performance in ICS. The academic scores of SPECS participants were significantly higher than non-participants (80.16±5.33 vs. 72.79±10.39 in 2010, p<;0.05; 81.35±4.30 vs. 75.52±6.35 in 2011, p<;0.001). The SPECS not only improved students' satisfaction with teaching, but also their enthusiasm and performance in the ICS course.";

Temporal logic can not only be used as a useful tool for philosophical analysis, but also has important implications for other disciplines such as linguistics, mathematics, and computer science. This article aims to study the development of temporal logic based on data mining technology in computer science. First, it conducts in-depth research on the origin and development of data mining technology, so as to fully understand the development status and application background of data mining technology. Then explore the conversion problem from the temporal logic formula to its equivalent Büchi automata, and propose a new conversion algorithm, and finally compare the algorithm with the SPOT tool through experiments. The experimental results show that the results generated by the algorithm proposed in this paper are better than the other in certain circumstances, which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm in this paper.";

bibo:abstract "Performing speech acts is important for language learners in both daily life and in academic contexts. This paper reports on the first stage of an ongoing project at a Japanese computer science university. The study incorporates findings from conversation analysis research into the English language learning classroom in order to develop learners' oral requesting competence in conversation. Two in-tact groups participated in a 7-week program; a control group received no instruction, while an experimental group received a short course of conversation analysis-informed instruction focusing on requesting. Both groups carried out request-based tasks at three points in the study- pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and again after a 2-week delay; tasks included participants' self-assessments of their task performances. Preliminary analysis presented in this report focuses on these self-assessment data, tracking changes in self-assessments across time both within groups, and also comparing control and experimental groups. Results show a significant increase in ratings post-intervention in the experimental group, but not in the control group. Successful completion of this stage of the project allows further development of tasks and an instruction program for the specific needs of learners in a computer science academic context.";

bibo:abstract "The aim of this research is to analyse the learning habit of the undergraduate mechanical engineering students in the second semester and compare it within the last five years. My personal experience shows the big part of the students until the present period do not have learned the teaching material week in week out and just have visited the presentations or simply stayed at home. The situation is unfortunately the same by other subjects too at the university and the colleagues have the same experience from other universities and colleges in Hungary. The learning habit of the undergraduate mechanical engineering students could be followed and analysed if we can see the details of the downloading of the teaching materials. The analysing of the data made possible to draw conclusions regarding the learning habits of undergraduate mechanical engineering students. I analysed the saved data of downloads in the last five years to see the changing of the learning habits of the students if is it recognisable. We can draw the inference on learning habits after analysing the distribution of downloads before the test. The result of the analysing shows the students downloaded the teaching material on the day of test or the previous day. It means these students did not have enough time to read, understand and learn the teaching material before the test and these habits do not have changed in the last five years. The earlier analysing showed the situation is the same in the first semester and the undergraduate mechanical engineering students did not recognise the advantage of the learning earlier before the test. I have found strong correlation between the days before the test and the number of downloads of teaching material. It needs a didactical method to motivate the students to download the teaching material earlier and read it to pass the tests in higher percentage because this learning habit has influence on the results of the successful exams too.";

In addition, the Education Ministers of the European Union have agreed that a common environment for education is needed. Evaluation has become an instrument to accredit and, thus, to guarantee the compatibility between higher education systems. The key issue in Europe in relation to evaluation and quality assurance of higher education is no longer so much why evaluate but how to evaluate. In this sense, in Spain the Council of Universities has developed (and carries out) general guidelines that apply to all universities. However, this is not sufficient. A characteristic of the process is that it stresses the need to optimize the management task. This paper explains how this problem has been solved in the self-evaluation for the Computer Engineering Program of the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.";

bibo:abstract "Using video as a teaching medium, in addition to voice teaching, it also integrates with the video teaching into the material to enhance the motivation and effectiveness of the learners. Therefore, many studies often incorporate videos into teaching. In addition to video content, subtitles are also a way to convey information. Through subtitles to strengthen the meaning of the video, learners can not only understand the materials through auditory sense, but also use visual to study. However, the presentation of subtitles is not suitable for every learner. Each learner has its own uniqueness, that is, each learner has its own unique learning style. Therefore, in the learning process, if teachers want to improve students' learning achievements, they must understand the individual differences of students, teach students in accordance with their aptitude, and provide different teaching materials or teaching methods for different types of students' learning styles, so that students can get the greatest learning achievements. In this study, four different types of videos are provided, with or without subtitles, to analyze the types of videos suitable for students with different learning styles, as a guideline for future video teaching.";

The article is based on a case study that analyses how the Boolean cube has been included and explained in more than 80 different sources. However, organized material on the Boolean cube is lacking. We examine and show why the topic of the Boolean cube deserves to be studied in the course on Discrete Structures—a basic part of the Computer Science curriculum. The benefits of mastering such knowledge and programming skills are pointed out. A sample lecture on the n-dimensional Boolean cube (including selected exercises, their answers, hints or solutions) is developed and discussed. It introduces, generalizes and relates many concepts from different subjects in the area of Discrete Mathematics and outside it. So the lecturers can use the lecture when teaching those subjects. In this way, all these concepts become more understandable, applicable and useful to the students. The ways of teaching the lecture are also discussed. All supporting resources to the lecture are available for free use at [1].";

bibo:abstract "The research reports qualitative research studies focused on designing and developing e-learning dictionary of computer science terms and nomenclatures undertaking a didactical pedagogical approach. The main research was focused towards creating an e-learning dictionary system and its assessment of e-learning effectiveness. Motivation of the research is to avoid inconsistencies and language problems regarding translation of such terms and nomenclatures in literature textbooks and articles by providing a community of experts by invitation that will create an official and standardized translations. The authenticated users with administrative privileges will add, store and change and overall manage the e-learning dictionary. The primary administrator will grant administrative or reader privileges to learners based on authentication. This kind of approach is based on wiki approach by creating a community of users where unlike the wiki approach will be carefully chosen and granted approach by invitation and privileges will be based on user data validation. The research method was exploratory research to determine the best research design and then empirical research to describe accurately the interaction between the learners and the system being observed. The data were collected through focus groups and surveys, direct or indirect discussions and in-depth communications and interviews with prospective users, as well as with literature review of the experts in the field. We have used the pedagogical re-engineering process that we consider as important to be able to compare the effective system usage with prescribed scenario. The purpose of the research realized is in order: (1) to gather information and asses e-learning interactions between human actors and the developed medium of instruction-the software solution, (2) determine the distance between learner activities and preconceived scenarios. The observed route of a learner was used to give feedback information on the effective learning. This research gives valuable insight into evaluated e-learning impact of the online dictionary, practical issues and recommendations, secondly contributes in standardizing translation of Computer Science terms and nomenclature in other languages other then in English by providing an interactive interface and community willing to contribute.";

bibo:abstract "This work-in-progress research paper describes the results of research conducted as part of an ongoing project “Enhancing Motivation for Learning Through Gamification” on the attitudes of high school computer science teachers towards gamification. The main goal of the project is to develop a pedagogical-technological gamification framework to help high school teachers design and implement gamification activities. Teachers play a key role in introducing gamification into the classroom, but encouraging them to do so can be as much of a challenge as introducing any other educational innovation. Therefore, it is important to research teacher attitudes and use this knowledge to identify how to encourage greater use of gamification, particularly in schools where it is currently less prevalent compared to universities. The paper describes the research in this direction and focuses on investigating the attitudes of computer science teachers and the use of gamification in their classrooms, as they should be the most competent to introduce digital innovations. An anonymous survey was used as a quantitative research method. The research questions were formulated to find out to what extent teachers are familiar with gamification, whether they use game elements and/or digital tools for gamification in the classroom, and what teachers' attitudes towards gamification are. The last research question related to the comparison of knowledge, use and attitudes between the computer science teachers and the other high school teachers. The main finding was that computer science teachers use gamification to a greater extent compared to other teachers because they want to achieve a higher quality of teaching and believe that they know how to create gamified activities. These results will be helpful for further work as a focus group of computer science teachers will be formed to help design the gamification framework.";

bibo:abstract "This study proposes an Ontology for Computer Science (CS) students' profiles. This Student model will represent information about the CS student and will be created by extracting constructs and variables from applied questionnaires. The literature presents several instruments that analyze the student's profile and performance in STEM and Computer Science. Some questionnaires were used to determine the profile of CS students to extract constructs and variables such as (a) Sociodemographic and economical; (b) Personality Type; c) Academic performance in secondary education; d) Learning experiences; f) Attitudes toward Programming; g) Science Motivation. h) Parental/Social Support. Our overarching research question of this study is to answer: How can we build an ontology for the computer science student profile that identifies the main factors that motivated him/her to choose a course in this area? This study will build the proposed ontology using the Ontology Development 101 methodology. The proposed ontology will be validated with real-world data and intended to develop case studies to administer internationally validated questionnaires to university students enrolled in Computer Science Major-related courses in public universities. The expected results are to know and trace the profile of CS students (female and male) since secondary education to promote better actions that increase the interest of secondary school students, mainly girls, in the IT area. Thus, this work intends to build an Ontology of CS Students as part of a recommendation system that will make suggestions for actions that encourage more students to pursue a career in Computer Science and then, be able to increase the supply of IT professionals in the market: workforce, especially women.";

bibo:abstract "The need for programming skills is becoming increasingly ubiquitous within the fields of science and engineering. However, new professionals entering their respective fields, in addition to practicing professionals with years of experience, lack the education and exposure necessary to effectively apply software development to their work. In order to promote the increased use of software development within scientific and engineering fields, this research project primarily seeks to survey, characterize and categorize applications of software development. Additionally, it aims to understand how students interested in science and engineering might best be motivated to learn programming. An initial review of literature will be supplemented with original data collection through interviews and a questionnaire in order to reach research objectives. Data collection will allow for a comprehensive review of the current uses of software development for personal or intra-institutional use, as opposed to commercially produced software packages, and will shed light on the state of computer science education among students pursuing non-computer science majors. This review of practical applications, in addition to research-founded recommendations, will aid educators and professionals in advocating for increased participation in computer science curricula, and thus contribute to a more thorough and grounded preparation of the next generation of engineers and scientists entering the workforce.";

We believe that if a variety of perspectives are brought in during learning, learners' intrinsic motivation can be increased, and learning computer science can be made more engaging and personalized. In this work-in-progress paper, we propose the concept of `hats' for augmenting computer science learning material with different perspectives. Hats are different perspectives which can be donned by the learner while learning computer science. We propose examples of hats such as Programmer, Historian, Job Seeker, Troubleshooter and Visualizer. To enable the use of hats while learning, we propose a web-based interface to augment base learning content such as textbooks with additional learning content classified under different hats. To provide scale in populating hats, we propose algorithms to automatically find content from the internet that can be categorized under different hats. We also present the results from a pilot study conducted using the hats interface.";

Students worked on problems they were given and submitted their solutions interactively using a Web-based tool called MessageGrid. Students worked on the exercises in pairs but submitted individually. Each pair of students shared a WACOM tablet which each student could use to submit Ink solutions to the problems. The result was an interesting blend of a classroom format of reduced lecture and increased student interactivity, software-supported interaction between instructor and students, team-dynamics, and keyed versus Ink solutions to the exercises. A survey was given to the students asking them to assess the learning experience. This paper describes the exercises, the classroom environment, shows examples of student submissions, and presents and discusses the survey results.

We collected data from small group discussions among 56 CAHSI faculty staff and administrators using a Communities of Practice approach to collect evidence of community knowledge development. Emerging themes from data analysis included: a) successful initiatives for CAHSI students; and b) collectively identified challenges. These findings illustrate how the Collective Impact model supports CAHSI network members to be intentional in their efforts by assessing their progress toward a common goal, evaluating the effectiveness of their efforts, and making plans toward next steps. Moreover, capturing the dynamics of the Collective Impact Model allows CAHSI to promote multidimensional change by creating culturally responsive initiatives and learning opportunities for Hispanic students in CAHSI.";

In order to develop the hundreds of web pages necessary for the laboratories, the project team found it necessary to create an HTML compiler called HtX. In the same way as LaTeX can abstract the style properties of static documents, HtX abstracts both static and dynamic features of web documents, enabling rapid development, multi-authoring and consistent appearance of large web structures. We are now in a position to disseminate not only the course materials, but also the powerful tools that will enable educators everywhere to produce effective classroom presentations and laboratory materials, concentrating only on the content of the documents and leaving style and format considerations for automatic treatment.";

The present situation for Computer Science and Engineering major students is, although they have studied English for quite a few years, although they have passed the College English Test Band 4, they actually lack the ability to communicate in English effectively with native speakers. In the process of language teaching, importance should be attached to the appropriateness of a language as well as the correctness of language forms and fixed language rules.";

Applications have emerged with the capability to generate source code from natural language descriptions. These tools primarily utilize language models based on deep learning, which have been trained on a collection of programs and projects hosted in public repositories. One of these tools is Github Copilot, an artificial intelligence capable of generating source code that can be integrated as an extension into development environments. The objective of this study is to experimentally explore, analyze, and evaluate the suggestions made by the Github Copilot tool in programming topics related to the Computer Science degree at the University of Bio-Bio. We propose five steps: (1) collecting natural language statements for both general and specific programming problems; (2) utilizing Github Copilot to generate programs; (3) evaluating its performance; (4) conducting an analysis; and (5) measuring code quality. This approach allows us to gain an initial understanding of its effectiveness, emphasizing its application for well-established problems and monitoring its use for problems with distinct objectives.";

The regular aim of the annual practical course \"Electronics and Microsystem Technology\" is to design an electronic circuit, normally a piece of digital hardware. Another rationale behind it is to broaden the students' view of systems design. In 1999, we decided to use a walking machine as the target application platform in order to emphasise the need for an interdisciplinary system design and the control aspects of dynamic systems in general. Another aim was to cover as many levels of a (mobile) robotic system as possible, with the emphasis on electronics. In this paper, the walking machine itself and the specific task of the practical work are briefly described. Then the results are presented and the experiences gained from them are discussed.";

bibo:abstract "The Department of Computer Science at Hampton University was awarded the HBCU-UP TIP Project to reform three gateway courses and implement an intensive computing summer bridge program (SBP) in an effort to improve student academic performance and increase retention and graduation rates in the major. By integrating Computational Thinking into lower-level courses, the proposed project also seeks to strengthen Computer Science students and better prepare them to meet the modern demands in the field. In the first year of the project there have been several changes to the curriculum content of the gateway courses as well as the implementation of the summer pre-college program. The summer 2014 was the first computing pre-college program. There were nineteen participants currently in the summer program. The students were engaged and excited to be a part of this program. The Computer Science Seminar course served as the initiative for a supplemental undergraduate research award request. The course focused not only ensuring the students understand computer science as a field of study, but also how computer science impacts all fields of study and everything in their daily lives. There were several speakers, FBI, Industry, University faculty, and previous graduates. The initial results has been extremely rewarding as we noticed from their performance in the first semester program course, CS1. This poster will discuss the curriculum we used during the summer program, sample exercises, feedback from students as well as lesson learnt for us to improve next year program.";

bibo:abstract "This work-in-progress paper presents the development of a Concept Inventory (CI) specifically designed for Computer Science (CS) teacher training programs which are based on a wide experience in teacher-training. CS Teachers often do not have a formal background in CS therefore the objective of this paper is to identify and effectively address the misconceptions prevalent in the field of CS education. This is achieved by the following three steps: 1. Definition of key CS concepts, 2. Developing of multiple-choice questions that incorporate distractors based on widespread misconceptions, and 3. A comprehensive validation process which additionally ensures the effectiveness and reliability of these questions. The resulting CI focuses on the idea of conceptual reconstruction, aiming to enhance teachers' understanding of fundamental CS principles. The development process is iterative, grounded in educational theory and practice. The approach to developing this inventory illustrated in this work-in-progress paper includes a detailed approach to the creation of assessment questions, leveraging existing literature and expert insights. The paper also discusses the future plans for the expansion and adaptation of the CI, emphasising its role in elevating the quality of CS instruction. This work aims to significantly enhance CS teacher education by improving conceptual clarity and understanding in the field.";

bibo:abstract "Despite a steady increase in the number of Computer Science (CS)/Software Engineering (SE) bachelor’s degrees conferred by postsecondary institutions in the past decade, a critical gap exists globally between enrollment and degree completion rates among female students. The purpose of this research was to comparatively investigate, describe and analyze influencing factors of persistence correlated to the experiences and perceptions of female undergraduates in pursuit of their CS/SE degree. The study was conducted in two geographically, culturally, and economically distinct public universities in the U.S. & Ethiopia. Can persistence factors in pursuit of a computing degree in Ethiopia be predicted by factors reported to be effective in the U.S. or vice-versa?Automatic thematic analysis of the response data using sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling from the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) was used to provide a degree of objectivity to the interpretation of interview transcripts and write-in portions of online surveys. Quantitative NLP text analysis of qualitative data has scant literature precedence. Independent samples t-tests were applied to the computed mean of average sentiment scores for each auto-transcribed interview response, evaluating the hypotheses that state no gender difference in the perceptions of cognitive gains, the institutional difference in sentiment scores of course review, and mean difference in sentiment scores between the first two introductory CS courses. Moreover, this study identified and enumerated twelve contributing factors of success for graduating female seniors in CS/SE using LDA topic modeling through the algorithmic computation of auto-transcribed interview responses.";

The aim of our study is to illustrate program behavior and to prevent confusion about the program stack through visualization. To facilitate recognition, we used a toy consisting of a ball, pipes, and magnetic panels. The ball represents which line of code is executed, similar to the program counter. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, we present three examples based on the proposed method. The examples are necessity of loop to wait user input, necessity of loop to keep program running, and software testing. We conducted an experiment with nine participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The result suggested that the proposed method is expected to be effective.";

South Carolina also has a critical needs program that allows certification of college graduates in areas suffering teacher shortages, including computer science, through a nontraditional apprenticeship process. The primary goal of the proposed charter school is to provide instruction in computer science by qualified teachers. To that end, the school would employ certified teachers as classroom mentors along with computer science graduates as apprentices in the critical needs program. In addition to teaching, the apprentices would be encouraged to develop and market educational software and similar resources for other schools in the district. This experience would be beneficial for those choosing not to continue in teaching, and would furnish an added incentive for computer science graduates to apply for teaching jobs in the charter school.";

bibo:abstract "In the ever changing environment of education, the skills learned and applied in computer and data science (CADS) have expanded beyond the reach of siloed, single-subject teaching in the classroom. The need for interdisciplinary learning and constructs have increased as real-world experiences have become a necessity and time has become a scarcity. The progression toward this reality has been accelerated in a post-pandemic world. This paper reviews literature regarding this topic, looks at barriers impacting student learning, and provides resources to assist educators in weaving plugged, unplugged, and hybrid components into their interdisciplinary lessons to amplify the impact of CADS. It also provides a scenario for and a vision of learning if educators can utilize an interdisciplinary approach to their lesson and unit plans. The sample template provided focuses on a middle and high school education model where multiple teachers are responsible for teaching the same students in a team. The curriculum discussed in the template is based on topics covered in the New Jersey State Standards for eighth grade students, but is flexible enough to be molded for the needs of various grade levels and different state and local standards. By using multimodal techniques and generating greater synergy through interdisciplinary lesson constructs, more robust learning environments are created for both students and educators.";

Although many students take much longer than this, some students want to complete their degrees in as short a time as possible. These students could be motivated by getting into the job market sooner, reducing the costs associated with getting their degrees, pressure from parents or family, or pressure from themselves to excel. Beyond student expectations, there are other reasons a University may want to create a path for students to get their degree sooner than usual, such as political pressure. This study describes the challenges of creating a pathway for students to complete a four-year Computer Science degree in 3 years faced by a comprehensive regional university.";

There are a multitude of intrapersonal reasons to explain why students choose to leave the field of computer science, such as lack of confidence, a misconception or disinterest in computing, minimal collaboration, and lack of a proper support system (Gordon, 2016). In addition, some universities focus on theoretical computer science to the detrimental exclusion of practical aspects.

bibo:abstract "The article discusses the need to introduce an interprofessional and interdisciplinary approach to solving legal problems in the field of law, information technology and information security and provides Russian experience in the transition to a digital economy and the training of competent personnel. The introduction of a mediator - a specialist as a link between the classical legal education and technical competencies and knowledge in the field of information technology and the information sphere as a whole is proposed. The article also provides non-trivial questions that are already facing lawyers and technical experts. This is the complex nature of the information sphere, which incorporates other branches of law and fields of activity, the cross-border nature of the Internet, and the development of artificial intelligence as a new subject of legal relations, which incorporates other entities (creators, developers, users, sellers, distributors), and etc. The article analyzes and proposes the possible introduction by universities of the relevant disciplines in the field of information technology, the study by specialists of the legal branch of the technical sciences and their use in professional practice for the best solution and counteraction of problems in the information sphere.";

dblp:publishedBy "IEEE";
bibo:abstract "With the fast development and wide application of information technology, the problem of how to cultivate highly qualified computer teachers for primary and secondary schools has gained more and more attention. To be a qualified computer teacher, systematic and firm theoretical knowledge in computer science is indispensible, but not enough. High teaching skills and capabilities are also needed. So how to design a practical and effective training system for normal computer majors is very important and meaningful. In this paper, we investigate the issue of professional ability training and evaluation for normal undergraduates majoring in computer science. First, we propose the basic structure of a computer teacher's professional abilities. Then, we discuss the purpose and main contents of the professional ability training as well as the associated approaches. A suggested curriculum for normal computer majors is presented after that. And at last, we propose a set of criteria for professional ability evaluation of the computer majors.";

They differ greatly in software requirements and resource utilization. As an instance, we propose building a private cloud based on microservices with Docker and Kubernetes in our laboratory to match our labs’ typical requirements.The private cloud proposed in this paper is composed of multiple components such as authentication, service gateway, distributed storage, knowledge management, code management, etc. Furthermore, some typical research software systems are deployed as microservices in the private cloud. To satisfy complex software environment requirements, a multi version microservice is implemented. In our microservices platform, users can submit their own microservices and manage these microservices’ life cycle through a web interface. In addition, the platform will automatically start and stop low frequency services to improve resource utilization rate. We use laboratory resources to conduct experiments and build a platform. With deploying the platform in our laboratory, it shows that the platform meets most of typical demands in research work and improves research efficiency.";

bibo:abstract "Open source/free software can be extremely powerful and valuable at little or no cost. Student familiarity with open source/free software is essential for success in the computer science environment. It does, however include some risks: heterogeneous network security concerns, a steep learning curve, and frequent bureaucratic restrictions to overcome. This project overcame these concerns while providing a powerful suite of open source tools to interested students at no cost. More specifically, the software package adheres to security constraints of the institution's existing Windows-based network. Accompanying the package is an easy to follow, Web-based instruction manual allowing novice users to install a dual-boot Linux/Windows operating system configuration. Specialized programs validate user authorization and align Linux with existing network security settings. This product answered a genuine need to provide students the opportunity to learn about Linux and its benefits as a fully featured, application-rich, alternative operating system. The paper includes the results from the initial implementation and fielding of the distribution in the dormitories as well as the specific development, design, and implementation details. The paper provides a guide to engineers and educators who wish to broaden their computing abilities and opportunities by integrating new computer technologies into an existing network environment. It describes the analysis, process, and problems associated with selecting and implementing software for a heterogeneous network with administrative concerns. The presentation includes a demonstration of the software package and the Web based training program.";

bibo:abstract "A Resource Center for Computer Science (RCCS) has been established at Novosibirsk State University. The Center includes a ready-to-launch first year undergraduate program in Computer Science, complete with an edtech platform and original ready-to-go teaching materials as well as short requalification courses for the clients' teaching staff and various support services. RCCS is intended for educational institutions that wish to outsource curriculum and staff development for part of their undergraduate program without compromising the quality and appeal of their taught provision. Investment in original concepts and materials as well as recruiting top-notch academic staff for course delivery is often beyond the means of smaller schools in less affluent regions, especially if the program has to be centered on problem-solving and depend on lateral thinking and critical evaluation of knowledge. This is where the concept of RCCS is likely to be at its most useful: not only does the Center support rapid course deployment, it also has a profound effect on the client's staff who will, after a few runs of the program, be equipped, both intellectually and in terms of edtech, to develop further materials while adhering to the principles and quality standards promoted by RCCS. Furthermore, being an RCCS client enables such a school to run side-by-side its regular undergraduate CS program to cater for the needs of local industry, and an advanced one for a few students who may have a higher potential/aspiration, without the school incurring prohibitive costs.";

bibo:abstract "Predicting students' success prior to their admission to computer-related degree programs is challenging due to diverse educational backgrounds and varying skill requirements. Educational Data Mining (EDM) can be used to optimize the college admission process by selecting only well-equipped students for the program. The attrition rate of the College of Computing Studies at Western Mindanao State University remains high despite the rigorous admission process for the Computer Science and Information Technology programs. Many students fail programming courses, causing them to leave the program. This study developed a decision support system and ensemble models by combining Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Neural Network models using learning techniques such as voting, bagging, and stacking. The goal is to automate the admission of pre-qualified students based on their likelihood of success in programming courses. Factors such as SHSGPA, CET score, class rank, and specific personality traits significantly influence academic success. The combined models, particularly using stacking techniques, emerged as the most reliable and effective model for predicting unseen data compared to standalone classification models. Students and faculty members evaluated the functionality, reliability, and usability of the decision-support system. The feedback indicated a positive reception, affirming its potential as a valuable tool in the college's admission process. Future enhancements may include incorporating multiple intelligence and grit tests and exploring additional ensemble methods to improve predictive capabilities.";

bibo:abstract "Algorithms are considered as one of the foundations of computer science. In all the computer science programs around the world they are offered as a core course of their curricula. However, in order to write algorithms a good knowledge and understanding of mathematics is needed. It is then the purpose of this study to show how the performance of the students in the course of algorithms of the computer science program offered at the University of Sciences and Humanities (Lima, Peru) is affected by their performance in the course of mathematics offered at that same program. The period of study covered four years, from 2015 to 2018, making a total of 8 semesters. The performance indicators in both courses were the average of the final grades of the students in each course per semester. A positive moderate correlation between the grades in mathematics and the ones in the algorithms course was calculated. Additionally, a linear model which shows the dependence between these two variables (i.e., the averages of the final grades of the courses of mathematics and algorithms per semester) was determined. On the other hand, we have observed the performance in these same courses which were offered alternatively following a hybrid system (traditional+virtual classroom) during the 2018-II semester. Because the performance of the students in this hybrid system is better than the ones from the traditional classroom (2015-I to 2018-II) we suggest that some of the techniques used in the hybrid system should be applied (and will be) starting the new semester of 2019-I to the traditional classroom courses of mathematics and algorithms.";

Based on this research background, the article uses the product virtual method of 3D vision to digitally model the product, and digitize the model process according to the product production process and product characteristics. At the same time, we use the collaboration effect to compare the data in AutoCAD and the data in the 3D visual collaboration model. Perform collocation and combination, complete the conversion of AutoCAD images into three-dimensional visual images, and establish digital models to process the converted data to realize the virtual research of products.";

This study involved sixty-six computer science students at universities across Saudi Arabia who filled out an online questionnaire that contained twenty-six questions about mobile privacy and it was divided into five sections: browsers, accounts and passwords, applications and permissions, public networks, and information protection. The survey shows that while computer science students are informed about the possible risks of personal information being disclosed through their mobile devices, more than half of them are still willing to share personal details through applications that require private or sensitive information. Based on this study, although there is a decent amount of mobile privacy awareness among Saudi Arabian computer science students, there is still a serious need to improve it by raising awareness of the dangers of mobile devices and the risks involved in disclosing private information, and by presenting information in a more interactive format.";

bibo:abstract "Measuring the maturation of students' problem solving skills in Computer Science I has been a difficult problem, often tackled through assessment exams. These exams generate a snapshot of student progress before and after an entire course, but do not reveal how the students learn from one day to the next. This limited data provides a scant array of tools for assessment and for the development of future courses. We employ a new technique for capturing student development in vivo called Video Phenomenography (VP), which is based on the classic method commonly used in educational psychology and utilizes videos of the students while they are working on a programming problem. Early experiments have shown that this technique can highlight differences in the problem solving strategies of students and provide feedback on the success and pitfalls of a pedagogical strategy.";

bibo:abstract "In today's era `Digital' is a house hold name. As some way or the other technology is part of our lives. Digital media can be seen as the live example of the same. Digitization is in the air. It is peeping in our lives up to so much of extent that even if anything goes wrong we can rebuild the scene and investigate, what went wrong. While investigation we have to check, whether the crime has taken place through some digital media or crime has taken place and now digital media is used to build up the scene of crime and evidences. In this paper, we have discussed the computer forensics life cycle and a very much capable tool to investigate the digital media-Hex Editor.";

bibo:abstract "In current computer science, data structure analysis is undoubtedly one of the most important tasks. With the development of the times and technology, data structure analysis is facing many challenges. The main issue in this process is feature selection. Therefore, this article chose machine learning algorithms to optimize it. In the end, this article also verified the feasibility of the method of this paper through a comparative experiment between an intelligent data structure analysis system based on machine learning algorithms and a conventional system. The final result was that the average resource utilization rate of the intelligent system was 93.13%, while the average resource utilization rate of the conventional system was 86.45%, with a significant difference. Moreover, the resource utilization rate of the conventional system continued to decline over time, leading to lower work efficiency. Therefore, this study found that machine learning algorithms can optimize the efficiency of data structure analysis systems, thus completing the design and construction of a mature data structure analysis system.";

bibo:abstract "Students in sophomore computer science (ldquoCS 2rdquo) are required to study the properties of a number of standard data structures; that is, common patterns of organizing data in a computer program. Typically, students are first presented with diagrams that graphically depict the data structure, and then shown sample code that actually implements it. We have observed, however, that there is a sizable gap between these two representations, and that many students who master the former have great difficulty translating that knowledge into the latter. We suspect that our pedagogy could be made more effective by treating diagrams themselves as formal entities, and providing students with a way of mapping operations on the ldquoeasyrdquo (pictorial) domain into the ldquohardrdquo (programmatic) domain. To help develop this technique, we carried out a semester-long experiment in which students demonstrated their understanding of the material both in diagrams and in code. The goal was to ascertain the kinds of mistakes that are often made, and how a technique like this could be most effective.";

bibo:abstract "At the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the course \"Introduction to Computer Science\" (CSI) is taught using the programming language Java. In Israeli secondary schools, computer science is not a required subject, but those who do study it learn a procedural programming language at an advanced level. Some students who study computer science at the university level have thus previously been exposed to the field. Our research examined whether prior knowledge of programming languages contributed to the success of students in their first university programming course. The research included an examination of the correlation between prior knowledge and their success in the course. We queried students both about their familiarity with various programming languages, as well as about a variety of programming concepts. A partial analysis of the results shows that there is a positive correlation between having previously learned procedural languages (such as Pascal and C) and success in the course.";

This paper proposes a generic model for designing learning experiences for CS curriculum. The model builds on existing credit systems such as European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), to determine if a CS programme can be reshaped to a given period of time. Furthermore the model is capable of determining the student workload distribution across the different types of learning activities for a module. The distribution is computed based on information such as the number of credits for the module, the number of weeks in a semester, as well as the percentage hours of lectures, labs, independent study and other learning activities. Preliminary data collection and analysis was conducted in order to determine the percentages on 75 computer science modules taught at 14 universities from Ireland and UK.";

bibo:abstract "This Research to Practice Work in Progress Paper studies the high attrition rate problem of first-time computer science Freshmen students at most universities. The problem is worsened given the growing demand of Information Technology workers and due to the limited instruction of computer science related content being taught within the high school education curriculum. The result is that incoming college students who are majoring in computer science or in related STEM fields are unprepared. Additionally, the means to adequately meet the employment demand is less likely with the low percentage of workers from under-represented minority (URM) groups in jobs within the computer science related industry. Much research has been done on predicting and improving student's success, particularly with the first programming and algorithms course known as CS1 and being ready to take Calculus. The problem is difficult to understand due to the many factors that exists, such as students having different education backgrounds, not knowing what a computer science education entails, and student support systems at a new school. At our university, for three summers, we offered our incoming engineering students a pre-college 4-week summer experience to better prepare them for their first year. The student population targeted were from under-represented minority groups, first-generation, low-income, and women. The goal of the program was to better prepare the students for success by engaging and advising them with both, computer science and math content by bringing them together as a cohort, which is essential during their first critical year in a computer science engineering field of study. The goal of this paper is to study the attrition rates and gain insight on student success predictors for entering Computer Science students. Research has shown that pre-college programs can benefit student success. By targeting students from underrepresented minority groups our summer program integrates computer science and math concepts to better prepare students for “Day 1” of college. The research work employs the student involvement theory to promote student success and retention. With COVID-19 restricting students to online learning, challenges in student-faculty and student-student contact have significantly made an impact. In addition to online survey/interview data, math and computer science course completion rates were collected from our 87 summer cohort participants to compare with the rest of the students. Triangulation of all the data collected yielded some insights and confirmed others on predictors for student success and persistence. Specifically, the summer students were disproportionately affected by COVID-19, compared to the general population (i.e., they were readily not able to collaborate with their peers and approach faculty).";

After carefully considering ways of modifying the course offerings to include parallel computation, the decision was made to integrate topics in parallelism into appropriate existing courses in the curriculum. It is believed that this approach is pedagogically sound since students learn and use several different machines and languages over the course of their studies, ensuring that they have a greater opportunity to utilize their knowledge. This approach also allows faculty members to concentrate on those aspects of parallelism that are within their own areas of expertise.<>";

More extended use of the GSE in future space projects is suggested in particular during system tests and during flight operations.";

bibo:abstract "This paper discusses the ethical implications of product liability and strategies for teaching product liability as an ethical issue to engineering and computer science students. The product liability climate can have substantial impact on the working environment of engineers charged with product safety. Many product liability controversies turn on the notion of \"standard of care\", which has both legal and ethical dimensions. The importance of product liability as an ethical issue can be demonstrated for students by considering the well-known Therac-25 and McDonald's coffee cases as well as less-publicized but more common cases involving appliances and hand tools. Such cases not only illuminate ethical issues and dilemmas posed by product liability claims and policy, but also help to clarify the relationship between law and ethics.";

Based on the empirical understanding and research of the authors a suitable course structure has been proposed as a counter measure in view of saving the resources due to needless learning of modules. Computing course in Computer Science Education System is selected as a sample for discussion; likewise for any specialism in computing or any course in computer science, analogous course structure can be adapted in order to reduce wastages.

The course utilizes this natural interest in this burgeoning field to introduce concepts from electrical engineering and computer science to the often diverse student base enrolled in the course. Anecdotal evidence indicates that students from diverse backgrounds (including liberal arts) have a more thorough understanding of the role engineering plays in everyday life. At WSU, this has led to students changing majors into engineering from non-technical areas and also, to multidisciplinary design experiences for those involved.";

dblp:bibtexType "Conferences";
bibo:abstract "A senior level compiler design course in an undergraduate computer science and engineering program usually deals with teaching the students the basics of compiler construction. Since the impetus of such an undergraduate course is to deal with the issues of compiler construction rather than intricacies of different machines, it is instructive to generate the code for a simple stack machine, incorporating a hardware stack, rather than dealing with a register-based machine such as a microcomputer. However, the educational institutions have the latter as a well established computing platform. Therefore, for testing a constructed compiler for a stack machine, it is feasible to make a microcomputer-based stack machine simulator. This paper presents the working design of a PC-based stack machine simulator developed by the authors for use in an undergraduate computer science and engineering course in compiler design. This paper begins by putting forward the architecture of the virtual stack machine for which the simulator is designed and constructed. The stack machine's instruction set is explained and then followed by a discussion of its encoding scheme. The main data structures and the different stages of the simulator are elaborated upon, culminating in a description of the salient features of the simulator that make it an effective tool in a compiler construction course. This includes the simulator's different analytical features such as measuring space-time complexity to analyze the effectiveness of a compiled code.";

Embedded computers are essentially computational engines capable of sensing the environment, actuating physical devices, carrying out data analysis and planning actions. Embedded computers can thus enable machines to become intelligent and autonomous. The next technological revolution will follow from the ability of intelligent machines to network with other intelligent machines and with humans. As cyberspace permeates physical space, networks of autonomous machines will serve human needs proactively, not merely re-actively. The key technology which will facilitate the development of such systems is sensor networks, software agents, and adaptive middleware. The paper discusses the nature of algorithms required for sensor networks, a computational model and programming language for building and reasoning applications on such networks, and argues the utility of a programming model based on agents";

It is based on three years of hosting a one day event aimed at introducing computer science to 5-8th grade students. One major challenge in computer science education is fostering a commitment to learn, that is powerful and engaging enough for a student to be able to utilize learned skills to turn their ideas into reality and drive them to pursue computing. We present a theory for what is necessary for an effective introduction to computer science as well as present survey results from the first trial of the Throw platform which encompasses this theory.";

With the aim of evaluating and further developing a model for the instructional design of collaborative learning in computer science, five teachers were asked to design a course using the model. In addition, they were asked to evaluate the applicability of the model. Overall, the teachers rated the model as well applicable; a more detailed version of the model was derived on the basis of the feedback and the so called PlanCoLearn model was constructed.";

Completed in December 1991, the latest survey concerns the production and employment of PhDs who graduated in 1990-91 and the faculty of PhD-granting computing departments during the 1991-92 academic year. The results indicate that the production of PhDs in CS departments increased significantly; the number of faculty in PhD-granting departments leveled off for the first time in two decades; those departments employed more full professors than assistant professors for another first; and minority figures persisted on the low side.<>";

Given the prerequisite graph of courses, and one's career goals, the course selections every semester should be almost deterministic. Yet, no viable tools exist to advise students automatically, or remotely. Given the rise of online learning platforms, and a significant interest in non-standard degrees, the need for an institution independent and online educational advising system has emerged. Additionally, such a system can play a significant role in a learner's career progression in a rapidly changing career landscape. In this paper, we explore the design and implementation of an advising system that can serve as a blueprint for a smart advising system.";

Experiences gained in this way allows them to build mathematical concepts quickly and properly. On the other hand, modern algebra systems, such as MATLAB, accelerate advanced calculation and offer an excellent platform for experimentation, but they do not facilitate understanding of fundamental concepts. It is proposed to use jointly the functional approach and a modern algebra system (in this instance, the MATLAB software). This would reduce a danger of creating a clutter of unrelated procedures in place of a coherent system of concepts.";

bibo:abstract "In this paper, we provide a statistical analysis of data from the California Department of Education to determine whether students of different ethnic and gender backgrounds are equally represented in high school computer science classes in California. Contrary to public perception, we found that every ethnic demographic was accurately represented in the classroom. The percentage of students of each demographic matched in the classroom the percentage of students in each demographic for the state. We found that this representation does not depend on gender. The ethnic distribution of male students in computer science matches the ethnic distribution of the state of California. Similarly, the ethnic distribution of female students in computer science matches the ethnic distribution of the state of California. We found that, despite inclusion efforts, female students are still a minority in these classes. Only 15% of schools with computer science programs have enrollment of at least 50% female. Related research suggests that the most effective way to include female students is to integrate STEM programs into the school curriculum at an early age before girls start to associate with gender stereotypes.";

Some 350 students from different facilities of the University of Western Sydney-Nepean studied the new CS1. The learning environment, in its laboratory component, was based on DECstations 5000/20. The content of the software strand of the course was a typical, Pascal-based, introductory presentation of programming concepts, while the content of the computer system part was relatively new. It formed a platform for the introduction of engineering issues into the CS1. A progression of functional models first introduces simple computer components, and later leads to a complete system, presented in two variants: as a hardwired and a microprogrammed computer.<>";

Within the polar interactive theatre visitors where able to experience seven interactive stories specific to the polar regions, using multimedia techniques and largely based upon animations from remote sensing data related to the Arctic and Antarctic. Additionally, an Internet service and a conference on \"visual reality-on the use of geo information in multimedia\", were hosted. The contents of the exhibit and the polar interactive theatre have furthermore been combined on a CD-ROM which will be distributed free of charge to the \"Landesbildstellen\" and the \"Landesfilmdienste\" of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1999. These events further helped to communicate the usefulness and the potential contained in remote sensing information especially when dealing with remote and inaccessible areas like the polar regions.";

bibo:abstract "Higher education computer science programs traditionally focus on teaching a fairly common set of foundational programming and data structures concepts. While these foundational skills are necessary to prepare students for success as computer science or software engineering professionals, they are often insufficient to engage, inspire, and ensure persistence among the many students from first generation, low income and under-represented minority backgrounds who are pursuing degrees in computer science today. Within most academic programs there is limited opportunity for students to actually practice applying the skills they are learning to solve problems or to work with large existing code bases. Additionally, the focus on learning these foundational skills - often in discrete courses on discrete assignments - lacks the context and bigger picture that allows students to begin to develop a sense of belonging in the computer science profession. Revising the curricula within individual CS departments across multiple institutions to address these limitations would be extremely challenging and time-consuming. A viable alternative might be a scalable, non-institution-specific learning pathway that complements the knowledge and skills covered in most CS curriculum. In that vain, the Computing Talent Initiative (CTI), an institute at California State University Monterey Bay, has been offering a fully online program, called Accelerate, that is available for free to students studying CS from community colleges and state universities throughout California. The team is wrapping up the second year of offering this program, which has demonstrated promising results in helping students develop the skills and self-efficacy to make meaningful contributions to large, real-world software projects.";

Some of these have been designed to assist teaching and learning, whilst others, such as social networking sites and the wide availability of mobile devices, have become ambient in our students lives. The impact of this on us (as academics), is that the academic study (of computing, in our case) has become unbounded from physical space, no longer isolated to lecture theatres and seminar rooms. We could attempt to follow our students into this new world, but to understand how students learn to navigate and utilise these new spaces in relation to their academic studies, we need to understand the practices, social structures and identities that they develop within them. To do this, we need to provide a way for students to show us these spaces and for them to become our guides. In doing so, we can improve our understanding of students individual and collaborative working practices during academic study.";

We identified 21 publications in SCOPUS and coded them for comparison and synthesis. Through a meta-analysis, we found a medium effect size (g =0.656; p<; 0.001) supporting the influence of CS learning on students' change of perception of CT. Through qualitative synthesis, results show that CS learning experience influences perception of CT in terms of self-efficacy, behavioral & emotional engagement, and awareness of careers. Findings provide insights to facilitate CT education strategies and promote educational equity in the STEM field.";

bibo:abstract "This paper presents a method for creating assessment items in Computer Science courses. The method is based on Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives in the Cognitive Domain. The paper shows how the courses in a Computer Science curriculum are divided into the following three categories: problem-solving, theory-based, and both problem-solving and theory-based. A table has been devised recommending a percentage of the questions in an assessment instrument that should target one of the three main cognitive levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. Another table gives examples of questions that can be asked along the different cognitive dimensions. The method has been used for the past three years in an undergraduate Computer Science programme offered by a well-established university in a developing country. Overall, the performance of students in theory-based and problem-solving/theory-based courses has improved. However, the performance of students in problem-solving courses has not improved significantly. This suggests that there are other factors that influence performance in these types of courses which need to be addressed.";

It is believed that such collaboration represents how professional engineers function and is a friendlier environment to women who already face a number of barriers in an introductory computer programming course. Our exploratory research is to identify barriers, recommended by Scragg and Smith, present in CS 158 after the implementation of collaborative teaming.";

bibo:abstract "Enhancing interaction and feedback collection in a first-semester computer science course poses a significant challenge due to students' diverse needs and engagement levels. To address this issue, we created and integrated a command-based chatbot on the course communication server on Discord. The DiscordBot enables students to provide feedback on course activities through short surveys, such as exercises, quizzes, and lectures, facilitating stress-free communication with instructors. It also supports attendance tracking and introduces lectures before they start. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the DiscordBot as a communication tool. The ongoing feedback allowed course instructors to dynamically adjust and improve the difficulty level of upcoming activities and promote discussion in subsequent tutor sessions. The data collected reveal that students can accurately perceive the activities' difficulty and expected results, providing insights not possible through traditional end-of-semester surveys. Students reported that interaction with the DiscordBot was easy and expressed a desire to continue using it in future semesters. This responsive approach ensures the course meets the evolving needs of students, thereby enhancing their overall learning experience.";

The study aims to uncover the connections between progress tracking, motivation, satisfaction, and final grades. The research involved 126 students in a blended course covering economics and informatics. Progress through course materials was tracked using conditional activities, and students' progress was measured using self-assessment quizzes and badges. Results indicated a positive correlation between progress indicators and motivation, as well as a strong correlation between progress indicators and satisfaction. However, no significant correlation was found between progress indicators and final course scores. In conclusion, the study confirms that tracking progress indicators positively impacts student motivation and satisfaction but does not directly affect final grades. Future research should explore the mediating role of motivation and satisfaction in the relationship between progress tracking and final course grades.";

bibo:abstract "This work-in-progress paper aims to understand hard-to-comprehend class diagrams concepts (a standard in Unified Modeling Language (UML)) by CS students and to improve their understanding of these concepts. Fresh graduates have been reported (by the software industry) to face difficulties in solving real-world problems with class diagrams (one of many problematic areas). This incompetency affects software development negatively in the software industry when they join the workforce. Lack of proficiency in modeling knowledge leads to fault-prone software designs, which require additional testing and time for the developers in software development. To fill the skill gap, this research intends to develop a systematic pedagogical approach to help students understand these concepts better through checklist-based intervention and pair programming. Our proposed approach, in accordance with the SoTL (Scholarship of Teaching of Learning), in this study aims at conducting an empirical study in a software design course at North Dakota State University to (a) conduct a pretest to identify students' basic conceptual understanding and (b) post-tests to evaluate the impact of pair programming and checklist-based interventions. We will analyze the data collected from this session to find how much intervention and pair programming helped improve the learning concepts of software design in students and to meet industrial expectations by building skill setups for workforce industries.";

Course content includes ethical frameworks, presentations, current event and stakeholder analysis, formal debates, job seeking, and codes of conduct. Given the wide applicability of computer ethics and the crowded schedule in the course, our inquiry seeks to find ways of utilizing Gen AI to streamline content delivery, to provide opportunities for independent student exploration, and to aid students during preparation for class activities. In this paper, we first describe a novel assignment integrating Gen AI given to students enrolled in the Spring 2024 offering of our computer science ethics course. The findings from a survey addressing student use of Gen AI before and during the assignment and the analysis of assignment artifacts submitted by students are then reported. Finally, we present additional student data and results from our separate experimentation, both of which focus on the use of Gen AI for debate preparation. Our efforts reveal that Gen AI can be a useful instructional tool for a computer science ethics course but should be integrated carefully.";

Sixteen physical science teachers were selected from ten secondary public schools in one of Benin's urban areas. Results show that introducing handheld-based science activities in Benin may run into obstacles such as a lack of tools, inadequate facilities, and lack of funding. In addition, Benin science teachers do not study innovative technologies as part of their teacher preparation program, and lack pedagogical and technological skills needed to engage students in using new technologies.

bibo:abstract "An introductory computer science course entitled \"Engineering problem-solving with computers\" uses a novel combination of in-class active learning laboratories and out-of-class Web-based learning tools to teach sophomore engineers problem-solving skills using Maple and Matlab. This novel pedagogy is designed to maximize the benefit of in-class activities and to carefully regulate student out-of-class studying. A newly introduced tool, called CourseBuilder, is an XML based content management tool that resulted in remarkable improvement in student performance (one sigma improvement in exam grades) over past experience. We describe the content and pedagogy of this course and how it differs from past practice. We describe the further assessment that is required to better quantify the improved student performance. We propose additional novel teaching practices to further improve student performance and reduce teaching costs.";

bibo:abstract "There is currently much discussion about the undergraduate computer science curriculum. With the rapid changes in computer science, the need to stay current is mandatory while the ability to develop and implement a contemporary undergraduate curriculum is extremely time-consuming and costly. The four schools represented on this panel have each developed a different model to undergraduate computer science education. Each of the authors believes the work they have done has been successfully implemented at their home institutions. They also believe that these works can be successfully adapted by others. The purpose of this panel is to present these four approaches and generate discussions on their commonality and their differences. With this discussion, they hope to help other schools who are interested in course and curriculum development. They can share their experiences, their curriculum models and their materials with others who are considering change.";

The course components include hardware assembly, operating system and software installation, basic system administration, and a working introduction to the engineering design process through the completion of several collaborative projects involving content-based graphic design and computer animation. Through the three semesters, the course has gravitated away from a module-based survey of fundamental concepts in computer science and engineering toward greater student exploration of fewer topics most relevant to the projects. Continuing assessment of each phase of the course provides formative and summative feedback and has played an important role in the maturation of the course.";

dblp:bibtexType "Conferences";
bibo:abstract "The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in everyday settings in recent years has highlighted the need to develop comprehensive policies to promote the ethical use of AI. As the next generation of AI developers and policymakers receive training on technical AI foundations, it is also important to examine how discussions around AI ethics and policy are (or are not) woven into existing computer science (CS) curricula. Thus, the perceptions of current college students studying AI are valuable in two ways: (1) to assess how AI ethics is currently being taught at the university level; and (2) to understand the attitudes of this new generation of AI thinkers towards AI, both in general and with respect to AI ethics.This paper summarizes the results of a preliminary survey of undergraduate CS students (n = 41) enrolled in a machine learning course at a large public university in the United States. We use our survey instrument to assess student attitudes towards AI, AI ethics, and AI policy. We find that while CS students are generally very positive about the benefit of AI and use AI tools regularly, they are nevertheless worried about the ethical impact of current and future AI technologies. Moreover, although nearly half of the students we surveyed would be interested in AI policy as a potential career path, only a third of respondents believed that their university courses were adequately preparing them to engage in discussions around AI policy and regulation. In this paper, we further evaluate these survey results and discuss implications for AI education at large.";

This system involves the collaborative development of rubrics between teachers and students, the integration of machine learning technology in the construction of digital evaluation rubrics, the establishment of evaluation standards for project practice attributes, and mechanisms for data evaluation and improvement, including those driven by machine learning and big data technologies. Empirical evidence indicates that this approach significantly improves student engagement, teacher evaluation efficiency, teaching quality, students' problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, and the rate of implementation of continuous improvement mechanisms. It also fosters the enhancement of teachers' professional competencies, providing effective support and direction for the evaluation of introductory computer science courses.";

The only known extension to additives, based on monomial weights, fails to preserve this key feature: a host of cut-free monomial proof nets can correspond to the same cut-free proof. Thus the problem of finding a satisfactory notion of proof net for unit-free multiplicative-additive linear logic (MALL) has remained open since the inception of linear logic in 1986. We present a new definition of MALL proof net which remains faithful to the cornerstone of the MLL theory.";

bibo:abstract "Supported by a state grant, our team of researchers (consisting of both Computer Science faculty and Teacher Education faculty) is offering a series of Professional Development sessions to K-8 teachers. These Professional Development (or PD) sessions are meant to help K-8 teachers develop their understanding of core computing concepts (such as algorithms, programming, data analysis, and networks) and thereby develop strong computer science programs for their students. In order to offer effective and meaningful Professional Development (PD) sessions, our research team first intended to understand the perceptions and experiences of K-8 teachers about Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) education. This paper presents the results of a K-8 teacher survey that we conducted as a pre-cursor to our PD series. The results of this survey provided valuable insights about elementary and middle-school teachers' perceptions of computer science education, self-perception of their ability to teach and learn CS, and understanding of CS discipline and those who typically engage in CS activities. The impact of teachers' perceptions impact how leaders in education and the CS industry can meet the needs of teachers, who in turn can meet the growing demand of CS education in K-8 schools.";

bibo:abstract "This work in progress research paper focuses on effectively embedding the blockchain topic into undergraduate Computer Science (CS) programs without introducing a new course. The goal is two-fold: expose students to an important topic without requiring significant new resources, and enhance existing course materials with real world applications. The blockchain theory and technology is based on concepts that span almost the entire undergraduate CS curriculum. As such, it can aid educators in offering assignments that both reinforce lecture topics and relate to modern applications. Our work aims at providing adequate abstractions in each course to shrink the large-scale design and implementation of blockchain to modular pieces, each of which an undergraduate can understand and be expected to complete in an one or two week assignment. Current approaches to teaching blockchains focus on one course or a subset of electives. Some provide useful insights into potential assignment topics and courses in the CS program that should be targeted. Related work has also designed an interactive model of a blockchain for students to see how the various components work together. Inspired by prior work, we set out to answer the following questions: “Can we effectively teach students about blockchains by having students explore the concepts through embedded assignments?”, and “Are these assignments still within the scope of the course as described in the course syllabus?” To gain insights into these questions, a series of assignments were created targeting four CS courses. Since the student level ranged from freshman to senior the assignments fell into two categories: exploratory and implementation. Analyzed were 115 student responses collected between 2022 and 2023. The submissions consisted of the student's solution along with surveys that asked for the student's background knowledge and feedback on the assignment. Exploratory assignments were given in Introduction to Computer Science (21), and Introduction to Cybersecurity (36). Implementation based assignments were given in Hardware Systems (44), and Network Design and Security (14). In the first two courses, assignments asked students to research how blockchains work or how they are used in industry. In the last two courses, students were expected to provide a code solution to a problem along with a write up explaining their solution and the tests they ran to check functionality of their code. A background section was provided with the assignment explaining the motivation as well as expected behavior of the component of the blockchain. Instructors were encouraged to add any additional materials they deemed necessary to better prepare the class for the assignment. The data gathered so far answer positively our two research questions, as all assignments matched well the course topics, the abstractions did not overly complicate the assignment, and students increased their knowledge and skills related to blockchains. We continue to expand the availability and use of embedded blockchain assignments.";

bibo:abstract "ACM guidelines suggest that the introductory computer science sequence can be split into three courses, either to introduce more topics, or to cover topics in more depth. We have been applying the second approach for several years. We have found that covering introductory topics in depth greatly reduces the failure rate in upper level courses. We feel that without a minimal level of programming expertise, and the intuition that comes with it, students will have difficulty grasping the advanced concepts, and completing the large software projects, introduced in upper level courses. Our introductory courses therefore stress programming experience, problem-solving skills, object-oriented design, and software engineering principles. Our goal is not to weed out weaker students, but to allow them overcome their weaknesses early in the degree program. An important objective for all three courses is to insure that each introductory class prepares students for the next introductory class. This paper discusses the topics covered in each of the three introductory courses, including sample programming projects designed to give students the tools they need to succeed in upper level courses.";

bibo:abstract "We are witnessing a remarkable comeback of computer programming in schools. While computers seem to be accessible everywhere, particularly outside school, where children and youth are connecting to wider networks of other young users, their capacity to wield such devices critically, creatively, and selectively is decidedly less potent. Learning the language of computers introduces students to processes for thinking and solving problems and for engaging creatively and critically with digital media. Using the example of electronic textiles—computational artifacts in which circuits are stitched with conductive thread to connect microcontrollers and control sensors and actuators, I describe how we can broaden access, diversify representation, and deepen learning. More importantly, I illustrate how the introduction of crafting with computing in schools that serve marginalized populations can help diversify who makes and the kinds of artifacts that are being made, how projects can introduce more complex programming concepts and practices, and what kind of tools we can design to support novice programmers in coding and debugging hybrid artifacts.";

bibo:abstract "Research has demonstrated the positive influence of Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) programs in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) on students' educational journey and their development as scientists, ultimately aiding them in making informed career choices. However, traditionally, URE programs have primarily targeted junior and senior students who already possess disciplinary knowledge and exhibit a strong inclination to persist in STEM fields. This study aims to examine the effects of involving freshmen in the Industry-Research Inclusion in STEM Education (I-RISE) program, specifically in the disciplines of electrical engineering (EE) and computer science (CS), on student retention. The I-RISE program integrated research opportunities for undergraduate students with mentorship activities, facilitating the acquisition of relevant skills in applied computing and engineering techniques, research methodologies, and the attainment of internships. Analyzing the retention rates of three distinct cohorts of I-RISE participants over a span of three years revealed significantly higher retention rates compared to students who did not partake in the I-RISE program.";

There is considerable literature detailing why a syllabus is an important part of a lecturer`s tools, and what items a syllabus ought to contain. However, there is little empirical evidence to back up these claims. We investigate what computer science students report seeing (and wishing to see) on a syllabus, and compare those results against advice given in various syllabus design guides. We find that several topics listed as points of emphasis on syllabus guidelines are named by students both as important and as areas for improvement in syllabi. We do this as a first step towards developing a research program to derive meaningful data on what a useful computer science syllabus really contains.";

bibo:abstract "A critical barrier in providing computer science learning opportunities to all is the dearth of professionals who have the expertise to teach computer science. Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.";

bibo:abstract "This paper addresses the essentiality and importance of CiteScore as the most recent Scopus indicator to evaluate periodical publications in the area of computer science and communications (CSC), indexed and abstracted by Scopus (mainly including journals and magazines). Currently, the old indicator of Scopus, SJR (through Scimago journal report), is the most common way of calculating scientometric quartiles through Scopus. The study shows that CiteScore is the best alternative of SJR to find Scopus-related quartiles for the CSC publications. In fact, it may be the best rival for the IF-based quartiles (as the representative of WoS), at least for the CSC journals.";

bibo:abstract "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. By the onset of middle-school a gender-based computing experiential gap arises between male and female students. This disparity, which negatively impacts computing selfefficacy in girls, also influences course selection in secondary school and may be a variable in subsequent career choice. The underlying reasons for the gender-based digital divide, which may include socially pervasive gender stereotypes and a lack of early interaction with technology, are disparate and complex. Early intervention is required to ameliorate this gender disparity before it widens in high school. In order to address this issue and garner interest in the STEM disciplines, Barry University (BU) offered a two week coding camp for underrepresented girls in the North Miami area, in June of 2016 and 2017. Female students of middleschool age, unlike their male counterparts who tend to engage in solitary pursuits, use this adolescent developmental period to hone social skills within their peer group. The camp curriculum utilized the collaborative element to introduce the girls to the fundamentals of computer science, by familiarizing students with the concepts of design, critical thinking, and social awareness via video game coding with MIT’s Scratch software. Post-camp feedback from the participants, their parents, and local educators was positive with regard to the girls’ interest and a desire to pursue coding further and assessment of the student learning outcomes was satisfactory.";

bibo:abstract "The state of Qatar has embarked upon a novel challenging experiment of massively investing in its education and research infrastructures with the goal set on becoming a knowledge-based economy by 2030. World class institutions, such as Carnegie Mellon University, were therefore invited to offer identical versions of some of their undergraduate programs in Qatar. Numerous challenges inevitably emerged as a result of this rough transition that our students experience, particularly within Computer Science, which initially led to large attrition rates during the first few years. In this paper, we discuss some of these challenges that particularly occur during the first year. We shed some light on strategies taken in our revamped Computer Science introductory Freshmen Immigration course. We share our experience with how this course helped smooth this transition for first year students to make their experience more exciting and rewarding.";

bibo:abstract "Due to the increasing interest in integrating data into various instructional decisions, data science skills have become important to promote in Ed.D. students. Meanwhile, there is a similar increase in interest in improving communication skills among engineering students. The needs of these two communities open room for an exchange of skills and mentoring opportunities. Bi-directional, two-way mentoring emphasizes the reciprocal exchange of knowledge, skills, and experiences between mentors and mentees, transcending traditional hierarchical relationships. While these two communities could benefit from each other by helping their counterpart acquire or improve their respective skills, two elements must exist for bi-directional mentoring to be effective: commitment and recognition of each other's value. Therefore, in this research-to-practice WIP article, the researchers explore computer science students' perceptions of the importance of communication skills and the value they see in mentors helping them gain these skills. Mainly, we address the following research questions: RQ1: To what extent do computer science student value communication skills in their academic and future professional pursuits? RQ2: To what extent do computer science students value mentoring to learn and develop communication skills? RQ3: Is there a difference in the value that computer science students pose in learning and developing communication skills with and without mentoring? To answer these questions, we distributed a survey in two different classes at two different institutions in a southeastern region of the US in Spring 2024. In this WIP paper, the researchers present the results of the computer science students' values related to participating in a bi-directional mentoring program to learn communication skills. Overall, students value communication skills and know their critical role in their future. This is shown by high-scale scores obtained in mentoring for communications skills.";

bibo:abstract "This experience report highlights the benefits and costs associated with a decentralized organizational model in the early adoption of Computer Science curriculum in secondary schools. Cleveland Municipal School District (CMSD), a large urban school district, in partnership with Cleveland State University, and other community partners has implemented a district-wide initiative to implement opportunities for all students in all secondary schools to participate in a variety of Computer Science courses. CMSD's organizational structure supports local decision-making, which has afforded a high level of flexibility to schools to explore a range of traditional and emerging CS courses.While this flexibility has been advantageous to innovative approaches to CSforALL, it is not without a cost. Foundational research needed within this RPP is to study the size and diversity of student enrollment across the district. Course codes and names are created in a centralized location with little consideration to character sequence or formatting, but are assigned locally through decentralized curriculum decisions. Without codes for similar courses, we cannot determine with reliability what type of experience the students had and thus cannot speak to equitable access.To address this, this work documents a systematic review of the course data. Results include short term fixes, recommended solutions, and best practices.";

It explores how a digital simulation program could produce truncation or roundoff errors. The chapter explains how we can simulate the orbit of a planet around a Sun. It provides case studies that serves as stepping stones that lead to the creation of more complex models that are needed by industry. The gravitational force exerted by the Sun on a planet is equal and opposite to that exerted by the planet on the Sun, so the Sun will also move in a small orbit. The chapter provides a symmetrical situation where a rotation of the pendulum from its lowest position produces a moment that pulls the pendulum back towards the lowest position. Lagrange's equations can be derived from Newton's laws of motion. The chapter illustrates the formal procedure by again deriving the equations of motion for a pendulum.";

bibo:abstract "As states and districts adopt policies and programs to broaden participation in computer science, there is a growing need to effectively develop and support more computer science teachers. Instructional coaching is a form of professional development that districts can implement to provide ongoing support to teachers. In Chicago, a recent policy change made computer science a high school graduation requirement. The district adopted the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum and professional development program as the primary means for fulfilling the requirement. As part of the district’s effort to consistently offer equitable computer science experiences for all students, an emphasis was placed on supporting ECS teachers through coaching. Over the past five years, the district developed, implemented, and refined an instructional coaching model for ECS teachers. The coaching model continues to scale up across the district, with over 50 teachers participating in the 2019-2020 school year. The coaching team also adapted the model in response to the shift to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, the authors share details of the ECS coaching model in Chicago, its impact, and lessons learned from the past five years of implementation.";

bibo:abstract "The development of computer science and applications changes with each passing day. The software companies and research institutions put forward higher requirements for computer science majors' professional capacity and creative ability. However, many problems still exist in the current status of teaching computer science majors and directly affect the quality of professional training, so it brings new challenges for teachers to cultivate students' professional ability. The paper proposes the computer science majors' capacity improvement model, relying on academic discipline competition. This mode includes two aspects: on the one hand, the improvement of the curriculum system according to the characteristics of the various discipline competitions; on the other hand, the establishment of the collaboration between teachers and students, as well as the mechanism of teaching quality assurance. Through the statistics and K-means clustering analysis of the dataset about the employment and competition awards of graduates during the past three years, the result shows that the model of computer science majors' capacity improvement relying on academic discipline competitions is feasible. Moreover, the employability of the awarding students can effectively be improved, thus they have better career development prospects.";

bibo:abstract "Many computer based tools exist which facilitate collaboration among groups of students. The majority of such tools, however, simply serve as communication devices in substitute for face to face communication. This paper describes how computer science students can use their skills to collaborate in a new way. Using Web services to develop interactive content, a group of undergraduate computer science students collaborated to develop solutions for an assessment in an artificial intelligence course. The term Web services describes a new and exciting family of technologies for connecting online programs. Although they are rapidly becoming popular in industrial applications, we feel they have been ignored in educational environments, where they can serve as simple mechanisms for collaborating to develop content. This type of collaboration requires technical skill of a level higher than that of a computer user, but it provides collaborating computer science students with an excellent opportunity to employ the networked computer as an enhanced learning tool, and not simply a communication device";

bibo:abstract "Becoming a professional is a core identity we develop as we fully mature. This identity is developed quickly as one progresses through college curricula, as this is likely the first major exposure an individual will have to the profession and its members. A well-developed professional identity correlates with many positive characteristics of successful students, such as high resilience and low anxiety. This work in progress presents initial results from an ongoing interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA) on the experiences of computer science students developing their professional com-puter scientist identities. The individual discussed in this single case (n=l) analysis was a fifth-semester computer science major enrolled in an Rl, Southeastern, land-grant University. In this work, we discuss themes of his experience and the implications of connecting his story to his peers in the complete work.";

bibo:abstract "Identifying the reasons why girls lose interest in STEM fields during high school has long been of interest to researchers and educators. Significant gender differences exist in the choice of STEM-related careers, particularly in fields like informatics and computer science. To explore this issue, we analyzed the competitors’ lists from high school informatics competitions over the past five years. In addition, we studied first-and second-year gifted mathematicians from the Mathematical Grammar School. Despite extensive exposure to STEM subjects in this specialized high school, only a small number of female students choose to participate in STEM competitions. We present the reasons these female students give for not participating, even though they possess equal knowledge. Based on these findings, we recommend encouraging more female students to engage in STEM competitions. We believe this study offers valuable insights that can help balance the participation of male and female students in STEM competitions.";

These projects provide hands-on experiences that may encourage students to explore careers in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics. Engaging students in real-world problems can help them develop critical thinking skills and generate innovative ideas. STEAM projects can also spark students' curiosity and creativity. This paper will explore developing and implementing a STEAM lesson to introduce students to the engineering and design process and computational thinking. Moreover, this project also addresses a major environmental concern currently in New Jersey, specifically the destruction of the environment by the spotted lanternfly. Therefore, students are also applying skills in civil duty and environmental awareness as a part of their design and plan to eradicate this invasive species.";

This paper reports our empirical comparison of factors contributing to non-computer-science studentspsila sense of security between the US and Japan based on a questionnaire survey. Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) we identified two common factors contributing to the sense of security for students in Japan and the US: cognitive trust in terms of the integrity and competence of the service providers, and user interface usability of the systems and services. The EFA also identified two additional, different, factors in each of the populations. The third factor with US students is cognitive trust in terms of competence of the systems and services and the feeling of benevolence about systems and service without any reason, whereas with Japanese students it is the userspsila assessment of risks. US students have knowledge as the fourth factor whereas the students in Japan have experience as the fourth factor.";

bibo:abstract "Technological advances in the 21st century, especially in areas related to portability and mobility enabled the popularity of this kind of equipment for audio sharing, like educational podcasts. Podcasts are characterized as audio or video episodes with information that are made available on the Internet, allowing users to subscribe and automatically receive updates. Podcasts can complement face-to-face or virtual educational proposals through the establishment of learning dynamics that make the review and memorization/recovering process of topics worked in class simpler and more direct. They can also be used in scientific literacy classes as an element to establish a communication channel in the likes of a conversation, for example when dealing with another researcher in engineering and computer science courses. This approach can be combined with other computational resources with the intent of making the research and development process more contextualized and practical. As a result, it can expand the possibilities of interaction between teachers and students and make the process of knowledge construction more meaningful. In this sense, this paper presents a proposal for podcast episodes concerning scientific literacy, especially to research project development and the basic elements of scientific writing. It aims to contribute to the establishment of dynamics that facilitate the first challenges of novice researchers.";

Students need to be shown that mistakes are indicators of how well they have mastered the material and how alert they are when working on the material. They need to view mistakes as an opportunity to improve rather than in the more negative light as an \"ego deflater\". In order to help data structure students in the Computer Systems Engineering Department at the University of Arkansas to become more motivated and to give themselves a chance to complete the program assignments, several techniques were used to help students complete the program assignments adequately. At the beginning of the course, the students were given small assignments which were graded, but not recorded, in order to give them an idea of how grading would proceed in the course. Most of the students would complete these assignments. Furthermore, labs were given and reviewed in class to reinforce the concepts in the material just covered in lectures. The results of this method and tracking of student progress are discussed.";

bibo:abstract "New (interdisciplinary) Computer Science (CS) subjects in K-12 education have been introduced in recent years. Most of them have educational plans derived from CS Frame-works such as the K-12 CS Framework. To some extent the educational plans have the same core topic areas: data and coding (including data compression and data structures), algorithms (in-volving variables and software projects), computers and networks (covering topics like logic tables and data transmission) and information society and data security (consisting of collection and processing of personal data and asymmetric encryption). Various Computer Science assessment tests such as the SCS1, MG-CSCI, PSIv1 and the Fairy Assessment have been developed for different age groups. These tests mostly include computational thinking, programming or topics that could be categorized in the first two core topic areas data and coding and algorithms. Hence, the research desideratum was to develop a test specifically for measuring the four core topic areas. These core topic areas are part of the educational plan of the new interdisciplinary subject IMP (Informatics, Mathematics, Physics) for secondary schools in Germany. The test was piloted with 156 (m = 117, f = 37, o = 2) 10th grade students, approximately aged 16 at the end of the lower secondary level. We used the Item-Response-Theory (IRT) to validate the test. This work in progress paper presents translated items and the psychometric evaluation of the piloted test. The contribution for both researchers and educators in the CS education research field is the set of items of the research-based CS test in the four core topic areas for 10th grade students that includes item sets for the areas computers and networks and information society and data security.";

bibo:abstract "CS Principles (AP-CSP) is giving more girls and under-represented students access to CS education, but CSP has not reached all students. Concurrent enrollment (CE), in which students take CE courses in their high school for college credit, is offered in places and to students who may not have access to Advanced Placement. The CS-through-CE project, an NSF-sponsored Research Practice Partnership, aims to broaden participation in computing by piloting and studying CE implementations of Mobile CSP, an effective CSP curriculum that has now been adapted as a college course. Initial research has identified barriers and supports to implementing Mobile CSP as CE in two contexts (rural, low-SES and urban, diverse, low-SES). This poster will present factors that support or impede implementation of CS-through-CE at the external level (e.g., policy, systems, context), the post-secondary CE program level (e.g., instructor qualifications, student eligibility, school outreach), and school/classroom level (e.g., teacher availability, student recruitment, administrator support). We aim to gather feedback on these results, as well as engage with others with experience with or interest in offering CS-through-CE.";

bibo:abstract "Summary form only given. The IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS) has maintained a leadership position in the development of educational programs in computer science and engineering education and in insuring the quality of such programs. These efforts have been centered in the Educational Activities Board (EAB) of the IEEE-CS. The EAB has published model curricula in computer science and engineering and has specified appropriate design activities in educational programs in computing. Both ABET and CSAB (Computing Sciences Accreditation Board) publish guidelines which address basic requirements for quality programs. The focus of the Excellence Project, on the other hand, is to move from these basic requirements towards programs that in some respects can be characterized as outstanding. It is also the case that the project is in some sense addressing those issues that are unique to computing. Many of the aspects of excellent programs are not necessarily unique to computer science and engineering programs, but are shared by excellent programs in other disciplines. It is the intent of the Excellence Project to place these items in the context of computing. In looking at curriculum design we are attempting to relate it to a modification of the waterfall model for software design and development as a model for discussing curriculum issues in computer science and engineering. The same techniques should be useful, whether a new curriculum is being engineered or an existing curriculum is being re-engineered.";

bibo:abstract "A key strategy for broadening CS participation in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has been the enactment of a high school CS graduation requirement. The Exploring Computer Science (ECS) curriculum and professional development (PD) program serve as a core foundation for supporting enactment of this policy. The CAFÉCS researcher-practitioner partnership provides support for ECS implementation in CPS. An important part of the sustainability of the ECS PD model in CPS is the development of local workshop facilitators. Potential facilitators have generally been selected based on the CAFÉCS team's personal familiarity with active ECS teachers. Once selected, teachers engage in a two-year apprenticeship program to become facilitators. However, in the three years since the enactment of the policy, the number of ECS teachers and students has grown significantly. This rapid expansion of the CS teaching force has strained the ability to confidently identify new facilitators from a large pool of teachers and ensure consistency of workshop implementation. As a result, CAFÉCS is exploring how to supplement the ECS Facilitator Development Model through a proactive recruitment model and explicit support for the mentoring process.";

Rather than seeking a \"right answer,\" the assignment provides students with an inquiry-based model of ethical decision-making drawn not from abstract principles but from practical wisdom informed by broader social, political, and historical conditions. Because we piloted both the course and the assignment in the spring of 2024, we discuss preliminary insights on the assignment and, more generally, on the possibilities of combining community literacy and deep tech ethics in the computer science classroom.";

bibo:abstract "The school of Telematics at the University of Colima, Mexico educates students in computer science. It teaches compulsory English to all learners to help them develop their linguistic abilities to use them in their professional area in order to get a job with transnational companies, to collaborate with professionals of other countries, to participate in study abroad programs or to continue study in postgraduate programs. Besides the teaching of the language, it is necessary to facilitate student acquisition of other competencies, such as collaborative work, critical thinking, learning to learn skills and so on. Motivation to study the language differs from one student to another, which has encouraged us to innovate and to design a teaching methodology able to meet different computer students' needs. This methodology incorporates different elements that make it flexible and adaptable to diverse requirements. With such a program, not only do the English language classes contribute to the teaching of the language, but also to the promotion of other competencies that may enhance the development and improvement of academic data, professional knowledge and life-long skills in computer science students. In this paper, we present a language teaching methodology that combines different ingredients that encourage the development of varied abilities demanded by computer science students.";

In this paper we demonstrate how a very simple procedure can be used, with minor modifications, as a building block to solve a variety of seemingly unrelated problems in the field of graph algorithms.";

Although many students who leave the computer science program eventually graduate in other fields, the high number of drop outs is of concern. Previous studies have shown that computer science students nearing graduation tend to have common characteristics as measured by the Kolbe A/spl trade/ index. These studies also indicate that changes in instructional techniques could have positive effects with respect to retention. The position here is that many students who could benefit from the computer science program, and who could in turn benefit the field, are being discouraged from continuing. In the current study, the Kolbe results of all students entering the computer science program are used to suggest improvements in advisement and recommend changes in the learning environment to improve student retention.";

bibo:abstract "Analysis of course survey data are foundationally important because it has a close relation with students' skills training and talent development. However, there are multiple categories of classification information that characterized different students from different perspectives, such as genders, classes, types or regions. Compared to the correlation between survey data with individual kind of classification, consensus between those with multiple categories is more informative. However, traditional methods can not handle this problem with multiple kinds of classification categories. In view of the problem above, in this work, we proposed to conduct a new factor analysis method in the consensus fashion. Specifically, we computed a consensus structure of different categories of classifications and the similarity matrices for each factor, respectively. Motivated by the famous clustering measure RAND, we proposed a generalized method called Rmm which is used to compute the consistency of two different similarity matrices, with the option to adopt weights. Followed the similar spirit of Rmm, we also computed pairwise consistency between different factors without category information. Experimental results show that: (i) Our Rmm method is capable to combine different categories of classification information in an effective manner;(ii) our Rmm method preserve promising linear property for the combination of classifications; and (iii) Our Rmm method can be used in the case of fuzzy similarity, which is more applicable in different scenarios. With the proposed method, this work attempted to figure out the veiled laws and covered from read data, with the hope to provide suggestions for course arrangement and personnel cultivating program in universities, and to shed light on personal development of university students who major on computer science.";

In the graduate program: the course number was initially INF7160 (computer science) and later became MGL7160 (software engineering). Until recently, the undergraduate course number was MAT3143, a mathematics course. From these various affiliations, one can be lead to the following question regarding formal methods: are they part of mathematics, computer science, or software engineering? We try to shed some light on this question. First, we present some definitions characterizing these various disciplines. We also examine our students' background to see in which discipline they really belong. Next, we briefly explain what are formal methods and how they fit within the software development life cycle. We then outline the formal methods courses that we have been teaching at UQAM over the last few years and conclude with an informal assessment of these courses.";

bibo:abstract "The future of AI will be determined in part by how its developers are educated. Thus, how computer science (CS) education incorporates instruction in various aspects of AI will have a substantial impact on AI’s evolution. Understanding how and what CS educators think about AI education is, therefore, an important piece of the landscape in anticipating – and shaping – the future of AI.However, little is known about how educators perceive the role of AI education in CS education, and there is no consensus yet regarding what AI topics should be taught to all students. This paper helps to fill that gap by presenting a qualitative analysis of data collected from high school CS instructors, higher education CS faculty, and those working in the tech industry as they reflected on their priorities for high school CS instruction and on anticipated changes in high school, college, and workplace CS. We conclude with recommendations for the CS education research community around AI in K-12, particularly at the high school level.";

However, there is an additional set of knowledge, skills, and dispositions related to equity and inclusion that are critical to effectively teach computer science to all students. The 2020 CSTA Standards for CS Teachers were designed to articulate a broad vision for what is required of teachers to prepare their students to effectively and equitably meet the learning outcomes delineated in K-12 CS standards and the K-12 CS Framework. One of the five teacher standards is focused on equity and inclusion, and this was also used as a cross-cutting theme throughout the other four standards. In this panel, authors of the standards and teacher development leaders will discuss how equity and inclusion can and must be infused into both the initial and ongoing development programs of K-12 computer science teachers.";

bibo:abstract "This Innovative Practice Work-In-Progress paper elucidates the approach of the NSF-funded CAHSI INCLUDES Alliance for creating change in students' competencies by an effort across eight institutions to support the delivery of one-and two-credit hour courses for three levels of problem solving in Computer Science: general problem solving, computational thinking in problem solving, and algorithmic thinking in problem solving. The courses were developed to address industry's need for improved problem-solving skills, incorporating consistent, deep collaboration with Google technical staff The first of its kind for CAHSI, the problem-solving courses are fewer credit hours than typical courses in order to fit within a traditional curriculum. The intent is to instill complementary problem-solving, computational thinking skills, and logical reasoning needed to succeed in computer science, and make this content available across different student populations at various stages in their academic pathways. Advanced problem solving prepares students for competitive interviews. The courses create opportunities to learn across academic levels, and create new student communities, mentorship opportunities, and social connections to support retention. The paper reports on the course design, student reflection, assessment and evaluation, and an ethnographic study of the courses.";

bibo:abstract "This Work-in-Progress research paper evaluates the validity of Large Language Models (LLMs) as conversational AI tutors for computer science learning. While current engineering education literature has predominantly emphasized the rapid evolution of LLMs as conversational AI tutors for programming languages, the exploration into their effectiveness within general STEM topics remains comparatively scarce. This WIP study thus centers on evaluating the potential of LLMs to facilitate understanding of core hardware design concepts critical to computer science and engineering (CSE) education. By cross-checking the responses from generative AI chatbots to an openended CSE-based question, we aimed to uncover how LLMs, such as ChatGPT-3.5, Claude, Gemini, and Meta AI, can contribute to teaching and learning of general CSE courses instead of a specifically coding-based one. Our method involved simulating a student query on the popular debate between CISC vs. RISC related to computer architecture and analyzing the chatbots' responses. This initial collection of data served as the foundation for a continual comparative analysis aimed at determining the inherent instructional value of each LLM and its validity and reliability. To systematically assess the responses, we introduced an evaluation framework focusing on metrics, such as response accuracy, persuasiveness, and depth of explanation. The current work anticipates not only enriching our understanding of how these advanced LLMs can support general CSE education but also identifying areas where further development is needed for a more holistic integration of LLM-based chatbots in assisting student comprehension in the overarching engineering education.";

The findings from our pilot study, present a complex picture. While students generally viewed comics positively and agreed on their potential as effective learning tools, the majority did not actually use the comic book for studying. Furthermore, these students did not report a better understanding of the subject compared to those who used traditional study materials.";

To address this problem and promote success in math, students declaring engineering or computer science as their major participate in a two hour (one credit) auxiliary course, SMET-SI (Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Supplemental Instruction currently taught as CE 198), that provides discussions and further exploration of mathematical concepts with an inquiry approach that applies these concepts in solving engineering or computer science problems using technology as an additional investigative tool. By helping the students see the practical engineering application of mathematics and use of technology at this early stage of their college career, the student will stay enrolled as an engineering or computer science major.";

bibo:abstract "In order to support query-based learning, this research focuses on the applications of an AI tool named AI2SQL.io in the instruction of computer science and engineering students in Structured Query Language (SQL). As the foundation for obtaining data from databases and manipulating vast volumes of data in a variety of vocations, SQL is essential to the field of data management. For computer science students, database knowledge and skills—especially SQL—are essential because they provide them with insights into the querying, altering, and analyzing of data—a crucial component of software engineering, data administration, and database management. Appropriate and effective techniques, including tutoring, which provide the student with individualised support, are particularly beneficial for learning SQL. It was noted that both situations allowed for the temporary usage of AI2SQL.io, as well as feedback to encourage selfdirected product immersion. In an effort to provide AI2SQL.io in a learning environment, this article reports on variations in student performance, practical SQL skills, and engagement levels. The article compares the efficacy of AI2SQL.io's case studies and effectiveness studies to other traditional tutoring methods, describing how the platform encouraged students to practise SQL outside of the classroom. The findings demonstrate that nearly all students made progress in both writing and composing SQL queries.";

And now, information and communication technologies have been deeply involved in this process, even more making extensive use of social networks as a pedagogical tool. This article summarizes a teaching-learning experience with quasi-experimental methodological design that uses the social network Facebook to try to increase the academic performance of students. With this purpose, two groups of a compulsory course were selected in the Faculty of Computer Science, one controlled with the traditional method and the other experimentally controlled with the help of the aforementioned social network. Results show an improvement in academic performance of students using a social network.";

As a result, the quantity of articles and journals published on COVID-19 has rapidly increase. However, these publications do not cover bibliometric visualisation sufficiently, particularly in the computer science field. Thus, the purpose of this article is to conduct a brief content review of the websites that offer bibliographic visualisation about COVID-19. Additionally, we propose a new framework for visually representing bibliometric data pertaining to computer science research and COVID-19. We believe that our method for bibliometric visualisation will benefit future research by serving as a guide. It will serve as a way for conducting COVID-19 bibliometric visualisation, in other areas, not limited to the field of computer science.";

bibo:abstract "The national call to teach computer science (CS) in elementary school is widely adopted, but how prepared are elementary teachers to deliver CS instruction? For this Work-in-Progress paper, researchers explore this question by gathering baseline data from 34 participants in a CS professional development (PD) workshop. The PD aims to develop teachers’ professional knowledge and skills to teach computer science from kindergarten through grade 8. The PD instruction included an overview of the current context of CS education, the landscape of CS as a field, a review of State CS student learning standards, a primer on computer science principles, and issues of equity in CS and inclusive practices to meet the needs of students, with a focus on English Learners (EL), students with disability (SD), and under-represented students of color (USC). Participants completed a pre-post CS attitudinal survey. Descriptive statistical analysis indicates that participant responses aligned with the issues of addressed in the PD, with little change in believing CS education can improve learning or learner experiences for focus students. Overall, while adopting CS education in elementary schools is crucial to ensure all students have access to 21st-century skills, research on K-8 CS teachers would benefit PD that further develops need tools to assess stakeholders’ understanding of CS and support all students, particularly those who are underrepresented in CS. Hence, this pilot CS attitudinal instrument provides a template to create tools to gather the necessary data to make informed decisions.";

These studies were designed to investigate a various of impacts of an Earth Science Computer-Assisted Tutorial (ESCAT), developed by the research team, on students' Earth science achievement and their attitudes toward Earth Science in senior high schools. The pretest-posttest control-group experimental design was adopted by all the three studies. Quantitative data were collected on students' pre- and post-treatment achievement and attitudes toward Earth Science measures. The multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that (a) the ESCAT has promise; (b) the \"problem-solving\" design of ESCAT is generally better than the \"nonproblem-solving\" design of the ESCAT; and (c) the \"teacher-directed\" ESCAT seems to produce statistically greater student gains than the \"student-controlled\" ESCAT. These findings suggested that instruction, such as the ESCAT should be more broadly developed and widely employed in the secondary Earth Science classrooms.";

bibo:abstract "Common curriculum designs for introductory computer science courses consist of various topics, but those topics are quite noncoherent. Due to the non-coherence, students would have great difficulty in understanding the relationship between the natural language of the problem and the electron flow in the devices inside a computer. In this paper, we present the coherent curriculum design of this course. We first introduce the levels of transformation, including problem description, algorithm, programming languages, instruction set architecture (ISA), microarchitecture, circuits, and devices, from top to bottom. Based on the levels of transformation, students obtain a whole picture of how a problem is solved by the devices inside a computer. Then students learn the structure of a computer. We adopt an educational ISA, the LC3, to form the foundation of this coherent curriculum design. Based on the LC3 ISA, students learn to write machine language programs and assembly language programs and run those programs in the LC3 microarchitecture. We also adopt a GUI-based LC3 simulator to demonstrate the information flow in the LC3 data path. This helps students understand the detailed behavior of the computer hardware and software. We evaluate the proposed coherent curriculum design based on students' performance and questionnaire. The evaluation results show the effectiveness of the proposed coherent curriculum design. The coherent curriculum design improves students' final scores. The mean scores of coherent curriculum design outperform the ones of noncoherent curriculum design.";

Students developed a full set of specifications for the robot and Web server system and maintained a project management plan and schedule throughout the semester. Unique aspects of the course include an electronic project log that is shared using a course information system and a peer evaluation system that constitutes a significant portion of the final grade. The course allows students to explore their disciplines further, gain experience working in interdisciplinary teams, and learn the importance of technical communication via a final design report and presentation. Nearly all of the students reported that they learned more working in an interdisciplinary setting than they would have working only in their discipline.";

bibo:abstract "Many prospective undergraduate students do not have the opportunity to experience computer programming in high school. School districts either do not have the budget to hire qualified Computer Science teachers or there are not enough resources available to offer the courses. A lack of exposure to computers science can lead to difficulty in retaining and recruiting STEM field majors. There is a challenge in encouraging community college students to pursue a STEM degree at four year universities. In this paper the “STEMpact” project, a cooperative arrangement by Union County College (UCC) and Kean University, aims to promote the success of Hispanic and low-income students in completing post-secondary degrees and to address the need for a diverse 21st century STEM-trained workforce. In this paper, a collaborative project in computer science is discussed for a student from UCC, who knew nothing about programming. The student began working with two Kean computer science students. A successful web project was completed and as a result of this collaboration the UCC student was motivated to explore more about computer science at a four-year university.";

CUREs integrate research activities into the curriculum, allowing all students in a course to participate in inquiry-based research projects. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are advanced AI designed to generate human-like responses by processing natural language inputs. These applications leverage machine learning models to produce outputs that can assist users in a variety of tasks from writing to coding. The integration of Generative AI with CURE had been adopted in a text-based machine learning course during the Fall 2023 semester. A comparative analysis had been conducted on student survey responses from Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 to evaluate the effectiveness of Generative AI in a CURE integrated course. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were conducted to assess differences in student perceptions between the two semesters. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the results indicate a promising trend towards improved student perceptions of both the overall course effectiveness and the benefits of Generative AI in enhancing various aspects of the research process, especially the literature review.";

The desire was to improve the readability of student-produced documents without displacing other important topics taught in the course. We outline a multi-step instructional process that involves evaluating the precise areas of writing where students in the class struggle, introducing students to a quick but effective approach for improving the readability of their compositions that is similar to debugging code, a motivational in-class editing competition, and assignments that reinforce learning. Anecdotal feedback indicates the approach produces worthwhile improvements in the readability of student writing submissions. We accomplish this while investing only a single lecture's worth of teaching time for writing instruction.";

English Language Learners are students who come from non-English speaking homes and backgrounds. With the increasing numbers of Hispanic students in many K-12 classrooms, Spanish is the language most often spoken by English Language Learners. During this year-long project, AP CS teachers attended a series of professional learning workshop on SI for Computer Science, and then utilized strategies from SI in their AP CS classrooms. Research outcomes of the pedagogical interventions identified new approaches to engage all students, through SI methods and materials used with the computer science curriculum. The SI pedagogy integrated with CS teaching skills shows how teachers can successfully engage more students in their classrooms, particularly students that may still be developing their academic English language skills, increasing CS education for all students. The SI methods used are explained here, for adoption by other computer science educators and researchers.";

bibo:abstract "Educating students for employment in computer science involves much more than teaching computer programming skills. Students must know how to apply those skills to real problems. Also, the student needs generic skills that include teamwork, communication, project management, independent thinking, and creative problem solving. Integration of these skills is required so that students can work on a team, communicate about, plan, implement and report on a programming project. But integration and practical application are difficult to teach in ordinary classroom situations. In this paper we describe an intensive 6-week summer course in which each team of students completely develops a project for a real client. The project is the framework upon which the student learns to apply and integrate knowledge learned in regular classes.";

bibo:abstract "Teaching research methods for scientific research may not be as common as teaching the same course in social science. It may stem from the fact that scientific discovery process varies from one field to another. Hence, when such a course is designed to prepare science students who are new to research, it should be helpful to encourage students to learn it hands-on. In this study, we redesigned research methods course for computer science master's students from a traditional lecture style to embrace an active learning approach. The newly-designed curriculum was exercised during Fall 2016 to teach 31 students majoring in computer science. We examined the course using authentic assessment, behavioral observation with its rubric template, and questionnaires. The results indicated that active learning is an effective pedagogy as students' research skills were greatly improved statistically significantly at p-value less than 0.01. Students confirmed that they found active learning highly useful particularly for learning research presentation skills and writing skills.";

bibo:abstract "This exploratory case study examines the impact of gamification theory on adult learners in computer science classes. This is an empirical study of how effectively adult learners retain and learn through the use of gamification and innovative educational techniques in the classroom. This is studied from the online and traditional classroom approaches. At this time, adult learners were more receptive to learning programming through entertaining and enticing puzzles and games in traditional and online classrooms. Their retention of knowledge gained from these classes was evaluated by using problem-solving puzzle assignments and in-class gamification results. The online and traditional classroom data were compared and contrasted to determine the effectiveness of gamification theory and educational techniques in the classroom by incorporating evidence from tests, assignments, and in-class gamification contests. This study demonstrates that students learn and retain more material on computer science topics when gamification theory introduces games, assigned work transformed into practical puzzles requiring technical problem-solving skills using software tools, and other educational techniques in the classroom. It argues for the use of gamification theory as a means to engage multi-generational students in learning complex and advanced material in a fun and involved educational setting. This can occur in both traditional and online classroom conference tools such as; Zoom, or Microsoft Teams.";

bibo:abstract "The Computer Science Department of Shippensburg University has recently embarked on the pursuit of ABET accreditation. While our existing curriculum was supported by the ACM curriculum guidelines, our assessment tools were insufficient for accreditation. In addition, since Shippensburg is a small teaching school, accreditation poses some significant logistical issues in the areas of teaching load and faculty development. As a result, we completely re-designed the structure of our program to meet these challenges. Our goal was a program where all of our students learn traditional computer science topics and basic software engineering principles and where they are allowed the opportunity to specialize in areas like software engineering, computer graphics, and real-time systems. Our required teaching load is 24 credits per year which makes professional development difficult. We significantly modified the structure of the program to allow each of our faculty members to teach no more than three courses and two preparations in a semester. This paper outlines the challenges, the process we used to address those challenges, and the resulting curriculum and assessment plan.";

bibo:abstract "Model curricula such as ACM/IEEE recommend that characteristics of students graduating in Computer Science should include project experience. In line with these recommendations, students in their fourth year of undergraduate study in the Computer Science department at the University of Botswana have to complete a major project as part of fulfilling the requirements for the award of a degree. The project gives students the opportunity to implement some of the theories and techniques learnt during the course of their programme of study. Students` choice of project topics therefore heavily depends on what the curriculum offers in terms of diversity of course content and techniques taught. This paper presents an analysis of 154 students' projects in the Computer Science department at the University of Botswana for the period 2013-2016 with a particular focus on the topic trends and issues of diversity and relevance to both the local and international context. The topics' list is categorized using the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering method. The analysis of titles and abstracts shows an inclination towards web-based systems and mobile applications that are relevant to the local context. Also, the titles and abstracts do not reveal core Computer Science areas such as algorithms, machine learning and security. Trending topics in Computing, which are also typically done as project topics, also seem not to feature. To reveal an effective categorization and assess comparability to international trends the rest of entire project document (body) needs to be analysed.";

bibo:abstract "The SALSA programming language was used in a two week module to introduce concurrent and distributed programming concepts to computer science II students at the University of North Dakota. Computer science II is taught using Java, which made for an easy transition to using SALSA for concurrent programming, as it has a similar syntax and allows the use of Java objects. The actor model was introduced, along with the and necessary concepts of concurrency, asynchronous message passing and distributed memory. As an evaluation, a survey was given to students before and after the module, with the results of the survey highlight the fact that early computer science students do have a natural understanding of many concurrent and distributed programming concepts. Further, they can make their minds up quickly, gaining confidence much easier than they gain actual knowledge. It was also observed that the students learned concepts better by applying them in programming assignments than by being presented them in lecture. This work provides motivation for longer, applied learning modules on concurrent and distributed programming in future early programming courses.";

bibo:abstract "This work takes a look at computer vision and graphics as interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary fields. Computer vision and graphics belong to the wide area of imaging but acquired their scientific autonomy with their own needs, goals, and methods. These two have brought many methodological contributions in interaction with physics, applied mathematics, etc. New concepts and paradigms were established and partly solved. They belong to the core of the two fields. They also generated a lot of important applications with societal impacts and, in turn, these targets led to new theoretical issues. This way, they reinforced their place as autonomous disciplines and investigated new research spaces. Computer vision and computer graphics have influenced the development of new sensing/actuating technologies as well. Therefore, their identification as such has been beneficial over the last decades, and trying to unify them very likely would be counterproductive in the short term for the many applications they address. This work discusses a key area where major examples can be found - medical applications.";

Three major threads form the backbone of the curriculum discussed here. The first is the use of interactive animation and experimentation programs to introduce and illustrate dynamic processes, e.g., algorithm behavior or changes in data structures over a period of time. The second thread is the use of graphics in student programs, not only as motivation, but also as a visual feedback and debugging tool. The third, unifying, thread is the extensive use of model programs, shell drivers, toolkits, and procedures that encapsulate abstractions. These programming tools support the apprentice style learning and illustrate good software design and practice throughout the curriculum.<>";

bibo:abstract "We present a study about the expectations students in higher education perceived to be placed on them. The study includes higher education institutes all over Germany, distributed over the different types of private and public higher education institutes that exist in Germany. All students currently enrolled in a computer science or related study programme were targeted; we distributed the survey by identifying study coordinators for relevant study programmes, contacting them via email, and asking them to forward the study to their student body. We received 638 responses from students all over Germany in an approximately representative distribution by gender, Bundesland (German federal state) and type of institute. The study was split into four parts: general statistical questions, general skills, domain-specific bodies of knowledge, and areas where students and educators often report problems. To analyse the results, we define the concept of agreement, which is the quota of students which note the specific item to be expected or mostly expected, in comparison to all responses. In general, only soft skills were expected by teachers, with programming language being the only domain-specific body of knowledge students agreed on whether they were expected to know it. This is the same answer as found by a prior study. We found that there does not exist a singular problematic topic but rather that all areas were received to be somewhat problematic. However, female students experience more expectations and problematic topics from teachers than male students.";

bibo:abstract "It is well known that many students struggle and eventually are unsuccessful in their attempt to complete their first computer science course. At Arizona State University, the first course taken by computer science majors and a few other majors is CSE 110. CSE110 teaches first year college students basic programming principles using the Java programming language. In order to do well in this course, students need to not only have a background in basic logical thinking, but also need to know basics about using computers along with Internet and file transfer protocol. To address this problem, a CSE110 workshop has been designed for incoming freshmen that have little or no background in computers. This paper defines the content and instruction of this workshop as well as an assessment of its effectiveness. To help ensure that future freshmen are better prepared, software development curriculum materials are being developed for use at the high school level. Two summer teacher workshops have already been held and a third is planned.";

bibo:abstract "The kind of students that currently arrive in the classroom in this technological age require a learning model that promotes their motivation for learning and thus boosts their creative thinking skills to develop disciplinary and cross-cutting competencies in their courses. It is of utmost importance to provide the students with comprehensive training and improve their competitiveness in their professional field by enhancing the skills of future generations to develop both the transversal and disciplinary competencies required that will allow them to become professionals who face challenges and opportunities in their future lives. Disciplinary competencies are the minimum necessary set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in their disciplinary field for students to perform successfully in different contexts. Traditionally, the evaluation of knowledge is used to evaluate the student's competencies in a course, and it does not usually reflect the degree of achievement of the student's competencies since these evaluations are based on specific topics and not on the acquisition of the competencies that the course should generate. The objective of this study is to design the evaluation criteria for the disciplinary competencies of Computer Science in students, as well as to measure their impact concerning the different subjects of their academic plan.";

bibo:abstract "Teaching a hardware-based course for computer science students is a very challenging task. Students need to do a lot of practical work in the laboratory, usually do some practical project, learn theory and finally take the exam. This is a very hard task for the first hardware-based course - Computer architecture and organization (CAO), especially if it is offered in the first year of studies. Many successful examples report introducing some online learning tools, such as distance laboratories or visual simulators, which help students easier to learn the required learning objectives. In this paper, we introduce a brand new approach of reorganizing the curriculum of the course of Discrete Mathematics (DM). This approach transfers the fundamentals of logic design earlier in the DM course. Since both DM and CAO courses are scheduled in parallel, this transfer and reorganization offers necessary background for topics learned in the CAO course. This change prepares the students with relevant content about digital logic part of the CAO course and results with an improvement of 50% of those who had passed the midterm exam compared to the previous years.";

bibo:abstract "Since 1968, ACM and IEEE Computer Society have jointly led the development of curricular guidelines in various computing disciplines, starting with Computer Science (CS). The last major release of the undergraduate CS Curriculum Guidelines (CS2013) recognized 18 knowledge areas underpinning the discipline; the next decennial release is also likely to have the same number of knowledge areas. Viewing these knowledge areas as distinct silos does disservice to their interconnected nature, especially as crosscutting or recurring themes run across them and help to unify fundamental concepts in the CS discipline. In this talk, I will discuss crosscutting themes as providing an orthogonal view of the CS discipline, a view girded by knowledge and experience gained over the past 50 years. Providing explicit instruction in the presence and variety of crosscutting themes in CS will help students see each area not just in a silo of insular ideas, but also as part of the ethos of the discipline. I will use examples from the different knowledge areas to show where Parallel and Distributed Computing could fit into CS.";

bibo:abstract "Experimental methods comprise the set of skills and techniques for minimizing error in acquiring and communicating measurements. One undervalued aspect of experimental research is the importance of communicating experimental outcomes clearly to readers. The way in which an experiment is done can affect what is written about it, and the way the results are described can affect the way an experiment is done. It's a two-way street, and each direction counts. The first part of the tutorial will cover a range of methodological details that are critical to good experimentation. This will be done in the context of writing a conference or journal paper that includes such details. This part of the tutorial is geared particularly toward students, but professionals may benefit from the different perspective that the tutorial offers. The second part of the tutorial considers the mechanics of actually running a complicated experiment. It deals with a number of practical aspects of the design, construction, and conduct of experiments in computer science research. The goal will be to see how a particular experiment in keystroke forensics was designed, how the design was extended into a plan of action, how the action was executed in the laboratory, and how the data were wrapped up at the end. Students will see the consequences of poor design decisions, and how to mitigate them. Students will learn by example how to design and conduct rigorous experiments whose results are dependable.";

There can be many barriers to developing endorsements in this relatively new K-12 education space. Through the work of our NIC we learned that time, cost, location, and relevance were all important aspects that teachers were concerned with, while the university departments were more focused on capacity, enrollment, rigor, and funding.

bibo:abstract "This work-in-progress innovative practice paper describes an active learning in-class activity to be used in introductory programming courses. In the software development industry, critical thinking, problem-solving, code review, and debugging are vital skill sets software engineers require to build software that meets requirements. Commercial software companies often have extensive code review processes to make sure that developed code is of high quality. Many new developers work in quality assurance and maintenance of software products. For these jobs, learning to understand code written by peers is an essential skill. Code review skills are rarely explicitly taught in required programming classes in CS, especially at the entry-level. In beginning programming classes, students are usually thrilled if they can find one way to make a program work. They rarely see, let alone generate, multiple approaches to solving a single problem. In this research, we propose an active learning approach that provides students with experience reviewing and analyzing existing code. In our activities, students practice code review skills by exploring multiple approaches to solve a single problem. We have developed an in-class active learning approach, called Code Insight, for entry-level programming courses. Code Insight activities are designed based on student-created answers to previous homework and midterm problems. Students are given the code to upload into their development environment, so they have the tools available that a typical software developer would have. Students use a classroom response system to report the correctness of these solutions by responding to multiple-choice questions. Preliminary results show that students prefer doing this activity to listening to lectures. In addition, students report that they learn more programming from this structure of the exercise. The degree to which Code Insight can improve student learning in beginning programming will be assessed using performance on other learning assignments, particularly those on programming questions in the midterm and final examinations.";

This is understandable because accreditation not only leads to better content and delivery of these programs but also allows these institutes to acquire good quality students and faculty members. One respectable body that has the mandate to accredit computing programs is the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). In this paper, we provide the details of our assessment and evaluation strategies for ABET-defined student outcomes (SOs) of computer science and computer information systems programs. The assessment is mainly carried out through a range of direct and indirect assessment methods, including summative data analysis, formative data analysis, exit exam, faculty survey, and alumni survey. Then, data gathered from these sources is aggregated and analyzed to quantify the attainment of SOs. This also forms the basis of the continuous improvement process activities that are the cornerstone of any accreditation-related activity. While presenting this, this paper provides details on the challenges that were faced during the process. The most important contribution includes strategies that were adopted to tackle these issues. A unique aspect of our institute is the academic environment that consists of segregated male and female students and faculty members in order to respect the cultural norms of the society. Another contribution of this paper is that it acts as a guide for institutes and their management that plan to embark upon the journey of accrediting their computing programs.";

bibo:abstract "Creativity and innovativeness are among the most essential attributes of engineering graduates and also of successful entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, or the process of starting a new venture, is one of the main roads to new technological innovations. This paper presents two novel models of entrepreneurship education integrated in computer science and computer engineering curricula and geared towards computing students with entrepreneurial intentions. To expose all computing students to entrepreneurial ideas and to spark their entrepreneurial spirit, we also developed several entrepreneurship add-on modules for existing CS and CE disciplines. All these programs have been developed and implemented at Hofstra University, with modules implemented also at Qatar University. Preliminary evaluation results are presented and discussed.";

bibo:abstract "During a NSF funded (HRD-0225228) study of gender parity in the School of Industrial Engineering (IE) at the University of Oklahoma, IE students' responses to questions about courses, experiences with faculty, and computers were noted. Over half of the students (21 out of 41) interviewed commented about Computer Science (CS), Computer Engineering (CE), or Electrical Engineering. Student responses fell into three categories: perceptions of the disciplines (12), perceptions of the departments (7), and perceptions of programming courses (15). IE students perceived these disciplines as intangible, populated by cubicle dwellers, limited, and lucrative. These disciplines need to better communicate their professional context. Perceptions of the departments came mostly from former CE majors who felt unwelcome there. Of the 30 students who had taken the programming course, 4 students enjoyed it and 11 students disliked it. The absence of an accepted pedagogy for beginning programming classes is felt by these students";

The main objective of this study was to examine several brain parameters (attention, concentration and the energy of several brain waves) in a programming orientated task, as well as their variability during tasks of varying complexity. We consider that this work presents very promising future developments, including the possibility of incorporating this technology into a customised automatic system adapted to the student's cognitive and emotional state.";

bibo:abstract "European universities are involved in a structural change in their careers in order to promote students exchange between countries. Taking advantage of this situation, Spanish University Council also is promoting changes in teaching methodologies. On the other hand, Spanish universities experience an important decrease of the number of students that arrives to the technical careers. This is mainly due to the fact that, in recent years, students move from the technical studies to the social ones. The reason is that social studies are considered, typically, more affordable. Finally, students who arrive at Computer Engineering studies often suffer a loss of motivation in their first year due to the fragmentation of subjects that is introduced into the studies. For example, hardware and software topics are explained in different subjects as if they were different disciplines. With the goal to overcome this situation the authors use a PBL based on robotics in the first course of computer engineering studies in our university. The aim is to motivate students who enter in the computer engineering career. This paper presents the design of a PBL with robots held in our department for several years. It discusses about the involved subjects and the need of resources, explores the suitability of robots for the PBL, and introduces the results of the two year experience application of this new teaching methodology in our studies.";

bibo:abstract "Understanding computer programming has become necessary in today’s life. In response to that, higher education institutions have begun to provide programming courses to non-computer science students. Learning programming requires a comprehensive teaching approach to generate students’ logical, creative and critical thinking. Based on past related studies, several factors have been identified to contribute to difficulties in learning computer programming including educators, students' abilities and programming nature. This paper focuses on these three factors and surveys to discover more about how these factors influence non-computer science students' ability to learn computer programming. An online survey was conducted on engineering students who have taken programming courses, which amounted to 241 students in this study. The analysis was applied to generally examine these three factors that influence students in learning programming subjects. Results showed that although students find it difficult to learn programming, most of them have no critical issues with their learning process. With these findings, it is hoped that this study can be used to improve teaching methods for programming courses to increase students' understanding and interest in the subject.";

bibo:abstract "In 2004 Northern Kentucky University began offering a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Technology. As these new majors began to enroll alongside Computer Science majors in the required and standard Computer Science 1 (CS 1) course, the context of CS 1 shifted. Accordingly, we made curriculum changes to adapt the introductory programming sequence to this new context. These changes included: creating a ¿CS 0.5¿ preparatory programming course taught in a variety of languages; allowing the scheduled laboratory component of CS 1 to be optional; and lowering the mathematics prerequisite for CS 1 from Pre-Calculus to College Algebra. We have studied the impact of these changes on student success. Because many Computer Science Departments in the U.S. began offering Information Technology degrees since 2000, in part to offset the downturn in CS enrollment, our results may be of broader interest. We found that gender, major, the programming language used in CS 0.5 and student attitudes toward technology (as revealed by surveys) did not affect student success in CS 1. Factors that were positively correlated with CS 1 success included mathematics ACT score, completing CS 0.5, and enrolling in the optional CS 1 laboratory section.";

The computer science curriculum at the Sudanese high secondary schools aims at qualifying the students to be computer literate, preparing them for entering college or the workplace. Nevertheless, this curriculum only introduces the students to computer hardware, peripheral devices and operating systems, it neglects to teach them the usage skills, basic computer applications, how to work with the Internet or emails. Also, it does not teach graphics and multimedia or gives the students the knowledge on how to install a computer program, keep their computers running in the most basic sense or how to handle the basic, day to day computer problems. Instead, it overwhelmed those beginners with programming, data processing, data analysis and system design. Accordingly, it has become clear that computer science curriculum at the Sudanese high secondary schools is not adequate to qualify the students to be computer literate or preparing them for entering college or the workplace, and that it needs massive revision and modification.";

bibo:abstract "The Digital Logic and Computer Architecture related courses are one of the key knowledge areas in Computer Science (CS) used to enhance students' understanding of Boolean algebra, logic gates, registers, arithmetic logic units, etc. and provides insights how software and hardware are related in a computing system. Experimental Centric based Instructional Pedagogy (ECP) with portable laboratory instrumentation might provide real hands-on experience to obtain a practical understanding of the concepts at a lower cost compared to virtual hands-on laboratories. This paper presents the initial adaptation of an evidence-based, experiment-focused teaching approach to introduce the fundamentals of digital logic concepts using the commercial ADALM 1K Active Learning Module in a Computer Architecture course for the first time in the CS department at a university serving predominantly minority students. To evaluate the impact of the ECP on student performance in the Computer Architecture course, we conducted three different evaluations, which are class observation, signature assignment, and the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MLSQ) survey. The results of the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) show more student engagement when ECP is implemented; the output of the signature assignment shows an increase in students' learning outcomes; and the MLSQ survey, which tests the students' motivation, critical thinking, curiosity, collaboration, and metacognition, ascertains the effect of the ECP on the CS students who participated in the experiment.";

Furthermore, students need to understand the process isolation vs. performance tradeoffs that must be made when designing hypervisors. This paper describes the experience of the authors in teaching a single-semester course to undergraduate students in designing, implementing, and debugging a hyper visor for an Intel 64 processor. Advanced topics in the course include how to capture and manage I/O and interrupt events in the hyper visor. The paper also discusses the use of a PCIe-based hardware module for monitoring and debugging the hyper visor implementation.";

bibo:abstract "This research-to-practice full paper looks into how first-year students at a Portuguese higher education institution respond to a Basic Informatic Skills tool. This instrument is used to help the industry better understand the students' preparedness and the domain of critical skills for success in Information Technology (IT) specialized workers. As this instrument has a set of questions regarding mathematical knowledge, problem-solving ability, and logical reasoning, and we believe solid mathematical preparation is essential to succeeding in a computer engineering degree program and career, we applied it to determine how well-prepared students are in mathematics skills at the entrance of a computer engineering degree. The test measures six subscales to identify critical competencies in IT: verbal comprehension, numerical aptitude, attention and resistance to monotony, logical reasoning, coding analysis capacity, and diagrammatic reasoning. In general, the student's verbal, numerical, numbers series and code skills of the used instrument (Basic Informatic Skills) were reasonable. Only the attention scale was worse, and the diagram capacity was better. There were only slight gender differences in the average coding and diagrammatic reasoning abilities. Aside from a slight correlation with numerical skills, age did not significantly correlate with any skills. We also determined the correlation among the instrument's several scales and several mathematical subjects, but no correlations were found. This study promoted reflections on the background of students entering a higher computer engineering degree in relation to mathematically based skills considered fundamental for any engineering course. These aspects lead to considering the effort that must be made in the teaching provided to fill these gaps so that students can achieve academic success with a set of curricular units and ultimately prepare them for the marketplace.";

It has been identified as a promising technique to improve students’ engagement which could have a positive impact on learning. This study evaluated the learning effectiveness and engagement appeal of a gamified learning activity targeted at the learning of C-programming language. Furthermore, the study inquired into which gamified learning activities were more appealing to students. The study was conducted using the mixed-method sequential explanatory protocol. The data collected and analysed included logs, questionnaires, and pre- and post-tests. The results of the evaluation show positive effects on the engagement of students toward the gamified learning activities and a moderate improvement in learning outcomes. Students reported different motivations for continuing and stopping activities once they completed the mandatory assignment.

bibo:abstract "During the early 1960s, scientists began to envision problem-solving computing environments not only powerful enough to solve complex problems but also able to interact with users on human terms. While many tried to create PSEs over the next few years, by the early 1970s they had abandoned almost all of these attempts. Technology could not yet support PSEs in computational science. But the dream of the 1960s can be the reality of the 1990s: high-performance computers combined with better understanding of computing and computational science have put PSEs well within our reach. The term 'problem-solving environment' means different things to different people. A PSE is a computer system that provides all the computational facilities necessary to solve a target class of problems. These features include advanced solution methods, automatic or semi-automatic selection of solution methods, and ways to easily incorporate novel solution methods. Simple PSEs appeared early in computing without being recognized as such. Some of the capabilities of future problem-solving environments seem like science fiction, but whatever form they eventually take, their scientific and economic impact will be enormous.<>";

At the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, where introductory CS courses are a requirement for CS majors and nonmajors alike, two tailored introductory courses were introduced as an alternative to the traditional course. The results were encouraging: more nonmajors succeeded (completed and passed) in tailored courses than in the traditional course, students expressed fewer negative reactions to the course content, and many reported that they would be interested in taking another tailored CS course. The authors present findings from a pilot study of the three courses and briefly discuss some of the issues surrounding the tailored courses for nonmajors: programming, context, choice of language, and classroom culture.";

bibo:abstract "Computer science is becoming ever increasingly important to our society. Computer science content has, however, not traditionally been considered a natural part of curricula for primary and secondary education. Computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at K-12 level entails. Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. In this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their K-12 education. The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. Computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. The most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school. A few countries have made it compulsory in both, while some countries have only introduced it in secondary school.";

Sound knowledge about AI and the principles of computer science will be of vast importance for future careers in science and engineering. Looking towards the near future, jobs will largely be related to AI. In this context literacy in AI and computer science will become as important as classic literacy (reading/writing). By using an analogy with this process we developed a novel AI education concept aiming at fostering AI literacy. The concept comprises modules for different age groups on different educational levels. Fundamental AI/computer science topics addressed in each module are, amongst others, problem solving by search, sorting, graphs and data structures. We developed, conducted and evaluated four proof-of-concepts modules focusing on kindergarten/primary school as well as middle school, high school and university. Preliminary results of the pilot implementations indicate that the proposed AI education concept aiming at fostering AI literacy works.";

bibo:abstract "The cloud has become a widely used term in academia and the industry. Education has not remained unaware of this trend, and several educational solutions based on cloud technologies are already in place, especially for software as a service cloud. However, an evaluation of the educational potential of infrastructure and platform clouds has not been explored yet. An evaluation of which type of cloud would be the most beneficial for students to learn, depending on the technical knowledge required for its usage, is missing. Here, the first systematic evaluation of different types of cloud technologies in an advanced course on network overlays with 84 students and four professors is presented. This evaluation tries to answer the question whether cloud technologies (and which specific type of cloud) can be useful in educational scenarios for computer science students by focusing students in the actual tasks at hand. This study demonstrates that platform clouds are valued by both students and professors to achieve the course objectives and that clouds offer a significant improvement over the previous situation in labs where much effort was devoted to setting up the software necessary for course activities. These results most strongly apply to courses in which students interact with resources that are non-self-contained (e.g., network nodes, databases, mechanical equipment, or the cloud itself), but could also apply to other science disciplines that involve programming or performing virtual experiments.";

bibo:abstract "In this paper we present a software platform called Chatbot designed to introduce high school students to Computer Science (CS) concepts in an innovative way: by programming chatbots. A chatbot is a bot that can be programmed to have a conversation with a human or robotic partner in some natural language such as English or Spanish. While programming their chatbots, students use fundamental CS constructs such as variables, conditionals, and finite state automata, among others. Chatbot uses pattern matching, state of the art lemmatization techniques, and finite state automata in order to provide automatic formative assessment to the students. When an error is found, the formative feedback generated is immediate and task-level. We evaluated Chatbot in two observational studies. An online nation-wide competition where more than 10,000 students participated. And, a mandatory in-class 15-lesson pilot course in three high schools. We measured indicators of student engagement (task completion, participation, self reported interest, etc.) and found that girls engagement with Chatbot was higher than boys for most indicators. Also, in the online competition, the task completion rate for the students that decided to use Chatbot was five times higher than for the students that chose to use the renowned animation and game programming tool Alice. Our results suggest that the availability of automatic formative assessment may have an impact on task completion and other engagement indicators among high school students.";

bibo:abstract "Teamwork is recognized as an important skill for engineering and computer science professionals. Both potential employers and accrediting agencies, such as ABET, expect students to gain proficiency in teamwork skills through experiential learning. Teamwork based projects challenge the student to apply the technical knowledge they gain in school to solve meaningful and complex problems. However, to be truly proficient in teamwork, a student must also learn and practice a large number of peripheral skills. These include planning, estimating, tracking progress, taking corrective actions, managing change, controlling and managing risks, maintaining ethical and professional conduct, communicating complex ideas clearly and concisely, using design automation tools, leveraging web-based tools for team collaboration, and most importantly participating effectively as team members. It is essential that students should be taught these important skills. It is unlikely that without adequate faculty guidance students can pick up these skills through ad-hoc project experience. Yet, many engineering and computer science programs expect the students to do just that. We feel strongly that we need to employ a more pragmatic approach in teaching students the skills necessary to function as effective and productive team members. Additionally, we need to develop criteria for assessing the effectiveness of teaching teamwork and the tools to measure learning outcomes. Among the problems contributing to this situation are the following: engineering and computer science instructors themselves often have had little or no experience operating in teams; training or guidance in effective ways to teach teamwork is seldom provided; and tools and effective approaches to assist in the teaching and assessment of teamwork are lacking. Another problem is that, it takes a great deal of faculty time, effort and energy to guide groups of students in doing effective teamwork. We will describe an approach that we have used to teach team collaboration skills using free and freely available web-based tools. Students learn to use tools for design automation, metrics collection, project management, and web-based collaboration. Our approach encourages students to learn teamwork skills and improves levels of collaboration among team members while reducing demands on faculty time and effort. Use of web-based collaboration tools allows students to participate without the need for frequent face-to-face meetings; this our students love. In an effort to maximize the use of techniques like the ones described in this paper, we hold regular informal sessions of interested faculty to share ideas on improving teaching teamwork and to develop methods and tools for assessment. The paper and the conference presentation will describe both our approach and the results we have obtained.";

In addition, many institutions offer ldquoblendedrdquo classes that include both on-campus and online students. These large blended classrooms have long suffered from a lack of interactivity. Many online classes simply provide recorded instructor lectures to which distance students listen after downloading. This format only reinforces the negative effects of passive nonparticipatory learning. At a major university in Shanghai, researchers and developers actively seek technological interventions that can greatly increase interactivity in blended classes. They have developed a cutting-edge mobile learning system that can deliver live broadcasts of real-time classroom teaching to online students with mobile devices. Their system allows students to customize their means of content-reception, based on when and where the students are tuning into the broadcast. The system also supports short text-messaging and instant polls. Through these features, students can ask questions and make suggestions in real time, and the instructor can respond immediately. This paper describes this system in detail and also reports results from a formal implementation of the system with a blended classroom of 562 students (of whom 90% were online).";

In the past, the course unit had a lecture-based format. In view of student underachievement and the high course unit dropout rate, a distance-learning system was deployed, where students were allowed to choose between a distance-learning approach driven by a moderate constructivist instructional model or a blended-learning approach. The results of this experience are presented, with the aim of showing the effectiveness of the teaching/learning system deployed compared to the lecture-based system previously in place. The grades earned by students under the new system, following the distance-learning and blended-learning courses, are compared statistically to the grades attained in earlier years in the traditional face-to-face classroom (lecture-based) learning.";

Web 2.0 principles include: the Web as platform, harnessing collective intelligence, data are the next Intel Inside, and rich user experiences. Based on a case study in a junior-level undergraduate class, this paper studies a set of six factors with comprehensive grading and evaluation criteria that are critical to make this approach successful. The six factors are knowledge base, motivation, research, social aspects, presentation, and feedback and support. The data collected show that most of the students who participated feel that this approach is exciting and rewarding, and that even some undergraduate students are able to produce original and innovative concepts. The data also show other interesting phenomena with respect to motivation, undergraduate research, and social aspects. Finally, the paper proposes a methodology of conducting a wiki project in a university class using a cyclic constant improvement process.";

bibo:abstract "The United States faces a shortage of computer scientists. Despite the current economic downturn, the most recent estimate indicates a labor force shortage of IT professionals. The shortage of IT professionals, and especially of computer scientists, provides impetus for increasing the representation of women in computer science (CS). We examine why so few students, and particularly few women, choose to enter the beginning phase of the CS pipeline by choosing to try out CS courses. Women are seriously under-represented at this early juncture of the CS pipeline. If we are serious about making CS a more inclusive field, we need to make an impact at this early juncture. This is not to belittle the laudable efforts to reduce attrition among women CS majors. However, for maximum effect, interventions to increase the flow of women into the CS pipeline also need to occur before women declare their major.";

In this paper, characteristic features of research article titles, including length, punctuation usage, word frequency, and preposition usage are investigated using a corpus of 600 research articles from the six journals of the IEEE Computer Society. Results show, while some of the intuitive observations made in the literature about title writing are accurate for computer science journals, other observations have ignored the effects of discipline and field variation. Subsequently, these observations are either unjustified or misleading.";

bibo:abstract "This paper explores the use of a constructivist 21st-century learning model to implement a week-long workshop, delivered as a “hackathon,” to encourage preuniversity teenagers to pursue careers in STEM, with a particular emphasis on computer science. For Irish preuniversity students, their experience of computing can vary from word processing to foundational programming, and while many schools are looking to introduce more ICT into the classroom, many students are left with a narrow view of what computer science is all about. Twenty-one students participated in the workshop and completed pre- and post-surveys, and a free word association exercise in the areas of computing and careers in computing. Analysis revealed that students’ motivation to learn about the design process, programming, inputs and outputs, and wearable technology (wearables)/Internet of Things (IoT) increased following participation. There were also increases in confidence in inputs and outputs and wearables/IoT following participation, as well as changes in the computing word associations, with students associating computing more with computer programming terms rather than general terms such as the Internet. The findings suggest that the combination of a hackathon event and a model for 21st century learning can be effective in motivating and increasing the self-efficacy of preuniversity teenagers in a number of emerging technological contexts such as IoT and wearables.";

This paper reports on an initiative designed to introduce underrepresented populations to computing using an eclectic, multifaceted approach. As part of a yearlong computing course, students engage in Maker activities, participatory simulations, and computing projects that foreground the social and collaborative aspects of CS. Collectively, these activities are designed to introduce learners to the growing diversity of what CS looks like in the 21st century. This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided-Wearing the Web-in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This article provides evidence on the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) for computer science education when using educational video games created by teachers using authoring tools. Background: Although teacher-oriented authoring tools for creating educational video games can help overcome the main barriers hampering the use and uptake of GBL, there is a lack of studies examining the effectiveness of educational video games authored by teachers using these authoring tools by means of rigorous scientific methods. Research Questions: Is GBL using teacher-authored games more effective than traditional teaching in terms of motivation for computer science students? Is GBL using teacher-authored games more effective than traditional teaching in terms of knowledge acquisition for computer science students? Methodology: Two randomized control trials with pretest, post-test, and one questionnaire were conducted to compare the effectiveness of traditional teaching and GBL in two computer science courses. The sample of the two experiments was composed by 75 and 49 students, respectively. Half of the students attended a traditional lecture, while the other half learned solely by playing teacher-authored educational video games. Findings: The results show that GBL using teacher-authored games was practically as effective as traditional teaching in terms of knowledge acquisition, but that it was emphatically successful in increasing student motivation. Students who learned by playing educational video games found the experience more motivating and fun than their counterparts, and a vast majority of them preferred the GBL approach over traditional teaching.";

This paper describes personal experiences and provides practical advice for successfully incorporating Mindstorms projects into an undergraduate computer science course, as well as highlighting the types of assignments that have not worked well. Specifically, the author has incorporated Mindstorms projects into five courses: Fundamental Concepts of Computer Science (a non-major Computer Science course), Programming I, Programming II, a general programming language practicum, and the survey of Programming Languages course. These courses will be summarized, and the paper will conclude with a general discussion of lessons learned about Mindstorms use in the classroom";

This is achieved by combining simulation-based laboratory assignments, which can be conducted anywhere and anytime, with compatible hardware devices that allow a seamless transition from simulation to real hardware, and a focus on performance-based assessment with an open-ended final project/competition. Content learning and retention is assessed for a subset of students who successfully went through the proposed curriculum. All class materials as well as hardware-in particular, a low-cost, highly articulated robotic arm developed for teaching advanced robotics concepts-are open-source and available online.";

This system promotes student collaboration and constructivism, without losing face-to-face contact. The MCSCL system was tested during a five week experience in a high school physics class. We observed both its qualitative and quantitative impact. Students and teachers responded very favorably to the system, and the experience also had a strong social impact outside the classroom. The MCSCL system provided a highly motivating learning environment that changed classroom dynamics and promoted collaboration between students. We obtained statistically significant results showing that the environment created by combining the teacher's instruction with the MSCSL system enabled the students to construct new knowledge based upon the previous knowledge provided by the teacher.";

bibo:abstract "Promoting computational thinking is one of the top priorities in CS education as well as in other STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Our innovative NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational thinking with creative thinking so that students leverage their creative thinking skills to “unlock” their understanding of computational thinking. In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear “dosage” effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 – 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 = .106. These findings support our belief that the addition of creative thinking exercises to CSCE courses improves the learning of computational knowledge and skills.";

bibo:abstract "Equity is arguably an agreed upon value within the Computer Science education (CSed) community, and perhaps even more so within efforts to universalize access to CSed within K12 settings through emerging `CS for All' initiatives. However, stakeholders often mean different things when referring to equity, with important implications for what CS teaching and learning looks like in schools. In this paper, we explore the question of how K12 school district actors' conceptualizations of equity manifest within their planning and implementation of district-wide CSed initiatives. Based on a research-practice partnership aimed at supporting and researching district-wide CSed initiatives, data presented - interviews with district faculty, district planning documents, meeting transcripts and field observations - were drawn from five participating school districts as they made decisions and enacted activities over 11 months in areas including vision-setting, curriculum, professional development, leadership efforts and use of formative data about implementation. Analyzing these data through equity frameworks found in CSed literature, we highlight three distinct but interconnected ways that district actors conceptualized equity within their CSed initiatives: (1) equity in who Computer Science is for, (2) equity in how Computer Science is taught, and (3) equity in what Computer Science is taught. Data show that these varied conceptualizations resulted in different kinds of decisions about CSed in districts. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of their relevance to equity-oriented CS education researchers, and what lessons they hold for policy-makers and education leaders engaged in their own efforts to support equitable computer science education.";

This study examines learning by making by students to explore STEM using a constructionist approach with a particular focus on computer science and engineering. The use of IoT as a technology enhanced learning (TEL) tool created the learning conditions to be studied: (a) collaborative: no one person had the knowledge to complete the project alone, (b) problem-based: no off the shelf solution was used, and (c) multidisciplinary: the learning context pushed the boundaries across the subjects. The study investigated the learning conditions and indicators of collaboration and production taking place when learning about STEM. The results were used to inform the design of effective data analytics and visualization tools for the PELARS project to advance practice-based learning activities in STEM teaching. However, more specifically, the findings provide insight into the knowledge construction process when learning through making in complex environments. These insights illustrate the combined pedagogical value of collaboration and production supporting the multidisciplinary learning opportunities. The importance of community knowledge construction and its relationship to the pedagogical approach is examined. The significance of these findings in the context of IoT TEL tools in education is explored.";

bibo:abstract "This paper describes a knowledge-based strategy for recommending educational resources—worked problems, exercises, quiz questions, and lecture notes—to learners in the first two courses in the introductory sequence of a computer science major (CS1 and CS2). The goal of the recommendation strategy is to provide support for personalized access to the resources that exist in open educational repositories. The strategy uses: 1) a description of the resources based on metadata standards enriched by ontology-based semantic indexing, and 2) contextual information about the user (her knowledge of that particular field of learning). The results of an experimental analysis of the strategy's performance are presented. These demonstrate that the proposed strategy offers a high level of personalization and can be adapted to the user. An application of the strategy to a repository of computer science open educational resources was well received by both educators and students and had promising effects on the student performance and dropout rates.";

bibo:abstract "This paper reports on work undertaken within a pilot study concerned with the design, development, and evaluation of online computer science training courses. Drawing on recent developments in e-learning technology, these courses were structured around the principles of a learner-oriented approach for use with adult learners. The paper describes a methodological framework for the evaluation of three main educational issues involved in the learning process of Web-based computer science training courses, and analyzes the results of this study with the aim of providing an improved learning design, and environment, for these courses. The findings highlight a number of potential barriers to learning and indicate the failed indicators that need to be improved in order to enhance effective performance. The authors give their views both on ways to improve the proposed learning environment and on the need for an optimal balance between asynchronous and synchronous activities, enhanced collaboration, and interactions among adult learners and e-tutors.";

bibo:abstract "In this paper, we develop and illustrate the use of a new theoretical framework to systematically investigate the development of student identity in Computer Science and IT. Identity has been identified as a critical issue in the endeavour to increase students' engagement in Computer Science and related areas. Findings from earlier studies indicate that students' doubts about future engagement are often due to an unfortunate perception of the discipline, that it lacks meaning, which leads to a tendency to dissociate themselves from IT and Computer Science as an area of further study. To understand different ways of experiencing engagement in the discipline as personally meaningful, we have integrated aspects of Lave and Wenger's social theory of learning, especially Wenger's notion of meaning, with a model developed by Entwistle that describes how conceptions of learning and knowledge expand and evolve in the context of the educational experience. We explore the use of this theoretical framework on reflections that we collected from all novice students of the Computer Science and IT engineering programme at Uppsala University, in which the students reflect on their choice of study program, goals, and expectations for education. The theoretical framework is furthermore discussed with respect to our broader research project to study students' identity development in Computer Science and IT as well as the role of education, how it supports or hinders students and how this can be used to inform educational development.";

bibo:abstract "Computational thinking and creative thinking are valuable tools both within and outside of computer science (CS). The goal of the project discussed here is to increase students' achievement in CS courses through a series of computational creativity exercises (CCEs). In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.";

bibo:abstract "This Innovate Practice full paper presents a cloud-based personalized learning lab platform. Personalized learning is gaining popularity in online computer science education due to its characteristics of pacing the learning progress and adapting the instructional approach to each individual learner from a diverse background. Among various instructional methods in computer science education, hands-on labs have unique requirements of understanding learner's behavior and assessing learner's performance for personalization. However, it is rarely addressed in existing research. In this paper, we propose a personalized learning platform called ThoTh Lab specifically designed for computer science hands-on labs in a cloud environment. ThoTh Lab can identify the learning style from student activities and adapt learning material accordingly. With the awareness of student learning styles, instructors are able to use techniques more suitable for the specific student, and hence, improve the speed and quality of the learning process. With that in mind, ThoTh Lab also provides student performance prediction, which allows the instructors to change the learning progress and take other measurements to help the students timely. For example, instructors may provide more detailed instructions to help slow starters, while assigning more challenging labs to those quick learners in the same class. To evaluate ThoTh Lab, we conducted an experiment and collected data from an upper-division cybersecurity class for undergraduate students at Arizona State University in the US. The results show that ThoTh Lab can identify learning style with reasonable accuracy. By leveraging the personalized lab platform for a senior level cybersecurity course, our lab-use study also shows that the presented solution improves students engagement with better understanding of lab assignments, spending more effort on hands-on projects, and thus greatly enhancing learning outcomes.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: In this study, an alternative educational approach for introducing quantum computing to a wider audience is highlighted. The proposed methodology considers quantum computing as a generalized probability theory rather than a field emanating from physics and utilizes quantum programming as an educational tool to reinforce the learning process. Background: Quantum computing is a topic mainly rooted in physics, and it has been gaining rapid popularity in recent years. A need for extending the educational reach to groups outside of physics has also been becoming a necessity. Intended Outcomes: This study aims to inform academics and organizations interested in introducing quantum computing to a diverse group of participants on an educational approach. It is intended that the proposed methodology would facilitate people from diverse backgrounds to enter the field. Application Design: The introductory quantum physics content is bypassed and the quantum computing concepts are introduced through linear algebra instead. Quantum programming tasks are prepared in line with the content. Pre/post-test design method and Likert scale satisfaction surveys are utilized to measure knowledge acquisition and to evaluate the perception of the learning process by the participants. Findings: Conducted pre/post-test design survey shows that there is a statistically significant increase in the basic knowledge levels of the participants on quantum computing concepts. Furthermore, no significant difference in the gain scores is observed between the participants from different STEM-related educational backgrounds. The majority of the participants were satisfied and provided positive feedback.";

This review presents a comprehensive study of works on Quaternion Algebra and GA applications in computer science and engineering from 1995 to 2020. After a brief introduction of GA, the applications of GA are reviewed across many fields. We discuss the characteristics of the applications of GA to various problems of computer science and engineering. In addition, the challenges and prospects of various applications proposed by many researchers are analyzed. We analyze the developments using GA in image processing, computer vision, neurocomputing, quantum computing, robot modeling, control, and tracking, as well as improvement of computer hardware performance. We believe that up to now GA has proven to be a powerful geometric language for a variety of applications. Furthermore, there is evidence that this is the appropriate geometric language to tackle a variety of existing problems and that consequently, step-by-step GA-based algorithms should continue to be further developed. We also believe that this extensive review will guide and encourage researchers to continue the advancement of geometric computing for intelligent machines.";

Thus emerged a new challenge for human-computer interface design: understanding the human user. In the current work, I describe four areas of understanding, which are human behavior, human limits, human needs and human cognition. These together form the basis of a new way of interaction between computers and us. A way where collaboration replaces commands; where respect of each other's limits is emphasized over limitless freedom; user interfaces become - dynamic and responsive instead of static and unaware; and self-explaining design instead of user guides. I will discuss how these factors are dependent on each other and work as an integrated whole to revolutionize interfaces. I'm presenting this work from a cognitive scientific point of view, which focuses on the human factor in information and communications technology and uses quantitative methods to analyze behavior, limits, needs, and cognition.";

Specifically, we use the titles of papers from the DBLP database to create what we call maps of computer science (MoCS). Words and phrases from the paper titles are the cities in the map, and countries are created based on word and phrase similarity, calculated using co-occurence. With the help of heatmaps, we can visualize the profile of a particular conference or journal over the base map. Similarly, heatmap profiles can be made of individual researchers or groups such as a department. The visualization system also makes it possible to change the data used to generate the base map. For example, a specific journal or conference can be used to generate the base map and then the heatmap overlays can be used to show the evolution of research topics in the field over the years. As before, individual researchers or research group profiles can be visualized using heatmap overlays over a specific journal or conference base map. We outline a modular and extensible system for term extraction using natural language processing techniques, and show the applicability of methods of information retrieval to calculation of term similarity and creation of a topic map. The system is available at mocs.cs.arizona.edu.";

bibo:abstract "The need for more post-secondary students to major and graduate in STEM fields is widely recognized. Students' motivation and strategic self-regulation have been identified as playing crucial roles in their success in STEM classes. But, how students' strategy use, self-regulation, knowledge building, and engagement impact different learning outcomes is not well understood. Our goal in this study was to investigate how motivation, strategic self-regulation, and creative competency were associated with course achievement and long-term learning of computational thinking knowledge and skills in introductory computer science courses. Student grades and long-term retention were positively associated with self-regulated strategy use and knowledge building, and negatively associated with lack of regulation. Grades were associated with higher study effort and knowledge retention was associated with higher study time. For motivation, higher learning- and task-approach goal orientations, endogenous instrumentality, and positive affect and lower learning-, task-, and performance-avoid goal orientations, exogenous instrumentality and negative affect were associated with higher grades and knowledge retention and also with strategic self-regulation and engagement. Implicit intelligence beliefs were associated with strategic self-regulation, but not grades or knowledge retention. Creative competency was associated with knowledge retention, but not grades, and with higher strategic self-regulation. Implications for STEM education are discussed.";

bibo:abstract "Mobile devices such as cellular phones and smart personal digital assistants out-ship personal computers (PCs) 20 to 1, and for many students the mobile device is becoming the computer. Such devices are becoming more powerful than the PCs of twenty years ago and they represent a useful tool for conveying important computer science concepts. This calls for innovations in the computer science curriculum, not only in some specific courses but across the curriculum to create a motivating framework for computer science students. After all, students expect faculty to integrate leading edge technology in the classroom. Here we present our approach for integrating mobile devices into the Computer Science curriculum, supported by an example of our experience in integrating BlackBerry devices into two programming courses, a distributed systems course, and senior capstone projects. Some of the courses are lab-intensive where students experiment with the devices, and develop and deploy applications for them. Teaching computer science and programming in the context of mobile applications provides a motivating framework for students and inspires them to excel due to the practical experience they gain allowing them to develop applications for their own mobile devices.";

bibo:abstract "Testing is a key skill for computer science students to acquire during their studies. To determine how well students are learning this skill, we conducted an empirical study in two offerings of a senior-level computer science course. The goal of the study was to determine whether students would be able to create a small, complete test suite for a simple program. The students created a test suite first without the aid of a coverage tool and then with the aid of a coverage tool. The results indicate that without a coverage tool, students achieved significantly less than 100% statement, branch or condition coverage. When provided with a code coverage tool, students increased coverage levels. Still, examination of the test suites indicated that they were significantly larger than the minimum required. These results indicate that students cannot conduct adequate testing of even a small program. To provide context for our results, we provide a literature survey summarizing various techniques proposed for teaching testing in the computer science curriculum. We discuss each technique, its strengths, and its weaknesses.";

bibo:abstract "Industry often complains that current university curricula fail to address the practical issues of real software development. This paper outlines a proposal for an innovative core curriculum for a Bachelor of Science in computer science. The proposed core curriculum contains elements of traditional computer science programs combined with software engineering via a team-oriented, hands-on approach to large-scale software development. In addition to traditional lecture/project/exam courses, students are required to take an eight-semester sequence of \"Software Factory\" courses. Software Factory courses put the students' newly acquired skills to work in a real software organization staffed and managed by all students in the program. Students from all courses in the Software Factory sequence meet simultaneously to fulfil their roles in the software organization. We expect the students will be better-prepared software engineering practitioners after completing a curriculum that combines traditonal courses with practical Software Factory experience.";

bibo:abstract "Previous research in STEM education demonstrates that students are engaged in a continuous process of identity development, trying to integrate their educational experiences with their perception of who they are, and who they wish to become. It appears increasingly apparent from this body of research that students are not well supported in this process by the education they currently receive. The goal of this paper is to analyse a specific aspect of the student experience, participation, in order to gain a better understanding of how computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) students engage with CS prior to and during their studies. Drawing on student interview data we describe and discuss students' qualitatively different ways of experiencing participation in CS and IT. The notion of participation applied here is inspired by Wenger's notion of participation in his social theory of learning. A phenomenographic analysis identifies a spectrum of qualitatively distinct ways in which the students experience participation in CS and IT, ranging from \"using\", to participation as \"continuous development\", and \"creating new knowledge\".";

In contrast, there is no evidence that learning required in programming problems, where students develop higher-level thinking according to Bloom's taxonomy, was exercised by using MCQs.";

bibo:abstract "Two recent curriculum studies, the ACM/IEEE Curricula 2013 Report and the NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing, argue that every undergraduate computer science program should include topics in parallel and distributed computing (PDC). Although not within the scope of these reports, there is also a need for students in computing related general education courses to be aware of the role that parallel and distributed computing technologies play in the computing landscape. One approach to integrating these topics into existing curricula is to spread them across several courses. However, this approach requires development of multiple instructional modules targeted to introduce PDC concepts at specific points in the curriculum. Such modules need to mesh with the goals of the courses for which they are designed in such a way that minimal material has to be removed from existing topics. At the same time the modules should provide students with an understanding of and experience employing fundamental PDC concepts. In this paper we report on our experience developing and deploying such modules.";

bibo:abstract "Constructivist approaches to computer science education emphasize that as well as knowledge, thinking skills and processes are involved in active knowledge construction. K-12 computer science curricula must not be based on fashions and trends, but on contents and processes that are observable in various domains of computer science, that can be taught at every intellectual level, that will stay relevant in the longer term, and that are related to everyday language and/or thinking. Only recently, two empirically determined lists, one of central content concepts (algorithm, computer, data, system, etc.) and another of central process concepts (problem solving and problem posing, analyzing, classifying, generalizing, etc.), have become available for computer science education. This paper tackles the problem of finding content and process concepts to be taught in combination. Computer science experts are surveyed in order to identify combinations of content and process concepts-so-called blocks-that are relevant to computer science education. By using cluster analyses, 15 central blocks for teaching computer science in schools are determined. The results of this study may serve as a reference system for the systematic design of instruction in K-12 computer science education.";

bibo:abstract "In the context of Computer Science (CS) education, one of the most important goals is the development of computational thinking (CT) and problem solving skills. Computational thinking skills are closely related to the CS concepts and approaches. These skills cover fundamental programming concepts such as task decomposition, abstractions and generalization, data structures and algorithms. On the other hand, CS education challenges, promote the search for new educational tools, methods, activities and resources. Consequently, CS education should be extended by adding the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) paradigm principles. The aim of this paper is to show how STEM-driven CS education supports and ensures the development of computational thinking at the high school. We present the already published STEM-driven CS education approach aiming at extending it by introducing a model to assess student achievements, according to the revised Bloom's taxonomy in the connection with CT skills. As a practical implementation, we describe a curriculum of Programming Basics at the high school with respect to STEM-driven aspects and CT skills. We introduce two case studies implemented in the real educational environment. They provide the evidence of availability of our approach.";

bibo:abstract "Women are underrepresented in Computer Science disciplines at all levels, from undergraduate and graduate studies to participation and leadership in academia and industry. Increasing female representation in the field is a grand challenge for academics, policymakers, and society. Although the problem has been addressed for many years, progress has been difficult to be measured and compared across countries and institutions, and has been invariably slow, despite all the momentum and impulse for change taking place across several countries. Therefore, it is important to reflect on knowledge, experiences, successes, and challenges of existing policies, initiatives and interventions. The main goal of this paper is to provide an overview of several initiatives, studies, projects, and their outcomes. It contributes to building a body of knowledge about gender aspects in several areas: research, education, projects, networks and resources. This paper is mainly based on discussions in working groups and the material collected for and during a series of talks on the topic held by the first author and by feedback received by the community. This paper provides the academic community, policymakers, industry and other stakeholders with numerous examples of best practices, as well as studies and recommendations on how to address key challenges about attracting, retaining, encouraging, and inspiring women to pursue a career in Computer Science. Future work should address the issue in a systematic and research based way.";

Based on the combination of two important digital libraries for computer science (DBLP and CiteSeerX), the knowledge networks are created at venue (journals, conferences and workshops) level and social network analysis is applied to determine clusters of similar venues, interdisciplinary venues and high prestige venues.";

bibo:abstract "The decline of student enrollment in computer science (CS) is a pressing issue for computing educators. One of the solutions is to provide K-12 teachers with CS related training. K-12 teachers play an important role in preparing students for college and helping them thrive in the 21st-century global workforce. This paper presents a comprehensive study of K-12 teacher training programs that target improving CS education. These outreach programs are provided by universities, mostly by computer science faculties. The paper first describes each individual training program with highlights for its particularities and contributions. Then it provides a side-by-side comparison of the programs based on different categories such as targeted K-12 teachers, workshop durations, curriculum development information, training tools, etc. At the end, summaries of these programs are presented. The successful strategies and lessons learned from these programs could be beneficial for future K-12 teacher training program development.";

bibo:abstract "Microsoft released its Robotics Developer Studio (MSRDS) and Visual Programming Language (VPL) in 2006. Microsoft VPL is service-oriented, uses workflow-based visual programming, and has strong support for parallel computing. It is a milestone and flagship in software engineering and in computer science education. Many universities and high schools have adopted VPL as a tool for teaching computing and engineering concepts and for programming robots. Unfortunately, as part of Microsoft's restructuring plan, the robotics division of Microsoft Research was suspended on September 22, 2014, leaving the Microsoft VPL community without updates and support. Arizona State University (ASU) is among the schools that adopted VPL since its first release in 2006. We started to find a solution to our VPL-based curriculum in 2014. This paper presents our research and development of a new visual programming language and its development environment: ASU VIPLE (Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Language Environment). ASU VIPLE extends the discontinued Microsoft VPL to sustain our curriculum and to help the community with their VPL projects. ASU VIPLE supports LEGO EV3 and all IoT devices based on an open architecture. ASU VIPLE integrates engineering design process, workflow, fundamental programming concepts, control flow, parallel computing, event-driven programming seamlessly into the curriculum. It has been pilot tested at Arizona State University in summer 2015 and in spring 2016, as well as in several other universities. ASU VIPLE software and documents can be freely downloaded at: http://venus.eas.asu.edu/WSRepository/VIPLE/.";

bibo:abstract "Computer science has been revolutionized by artificial intelligence (AI), which has opened up new paths for data analysis, modelling, and prediction. ChatGPT, a language model based on deep neural networks, has shown promise in natural language processing, picture identification, and data analysis. However, integrating ChatGPT and other AI models into scientific research presents obstacles and constraints. This study aims to analyze the limitations of ChatGPT and AI in computer science research and provide methods to address these shortcomings. Specifically, we concentrate on two primary goals: first, Domain expertise restrictions: There may be a lack of specialized subject expertise in ChatGPT and comparable language models, providing difficulties for researchers in particular domains. We investigate techniques to improve domain knowledge integration into AI models, allowing for more precise and contextually relevant predictions. Second, interpretability difficulties: The interpretability of AI models continues to be a significant challenge, impeding researchers' ability to comprehend how algorithms create predictions. We address this issue by suggesting strategies for enhancing interpretability, giving researchers insights into the decision-making processes of AI models. We hope to promote AI's ethical and responsible use in scientific research by addressing these objectives. We examine various strategies to improve the representation of domain knowledge within AI models and its interpretability, enabling researchers to utilize the benefits of ChatGPT and AI while limiting their limitations.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This paper provides evidence that computational creativity exercises (CCEs) can increase engineering students' learning in introductory computer science (CS1) courses. Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students' learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics.";

Yet, they can unintentionally disadvantage students with less prior game experience. This article presents evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach can effectively address this problem at the middle school level. In an iterative, designed-based research study, the authors first used an experimental pilot study to investigate the nature of collaboration in the Engage game-based learning environment and then deployed Engage in a full classroom study to measure its effectiveness at supporting all students during computer science learning. In early phases of the intervention, male students outpaced female peers in learning gains. However, female students caught up during a multiweek classroom implementation. These findings provide evidence that gender differences could dissipate over time within collaborative game-based learning experiences in computer science.";

bibo:abstract "Learning how to code by creating video games promises high motivation, engagement and fun for the students. In this study, the Unity Game Development Environment, a widely spread tool for professional game developers, was employed for teaching secondary school students to develop their own video games. The research design for the game development activities followed a Design-Based Research approach. The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games.";

bibo:abstract "Bioinformatics is a new and rapidly evolving discipline that has emerged from the fields of experimental molecular biology and biochemistry, and from the artificial intelligence, database, pattern recognition, and algorithms disciplines of computer science. Largely because of the inherently interdisciplinary nature of bioinformatics research, academia has been slow to respond to strong industry and government demands for trained scientists to develop and apply novel bioinformatic techniques to the rapidly growing freely available repositories of genetic and proteomic data. While some institutions are responding to this demand by establishing graduate programs in bioinformatics, the entrance barriers for these programs are high, largely because of the significant amount of prerequisite knowledge in the disparate fields of biochemistry and computer science required for sophisticated new approaches to the analysis and interpretation of bioinformatics data. The authors present an undergraduate-level bioinformatics curriculum in computer science designed for the baccalaureate student. This program is designed to be tailored easily to the needs and resources of a variety of institutions.";

Researchers have identified challenges related to teaching CS courses in sways that ensure underrepresented student populations are engaged, interested, and motivated to participate in computing coursework, including making course content relevant to students' lives and interests. An emerging area of scholarship proposes merging culturally relevant pedagogy with CS in order to develop engaging and rigorous computing instruction for diverse groups of students. Much of this work has been theoretical rather than practical; thus, we present case studies of three programs to describe practice-based examples of culturally relevant computer science teaching and learning. Consistent themes across the instructional practices we share include engagement and relevance; confidence and identity; and social justice. These foundational practical applications of culturally relevant CS education can inform efforts to enhance engagement, preparation, participation, and persistence in computing for underrepresented students toward successfully addressing inclusion, diversity, and equity.";

bibo:abstract "We developed two versions of a system, called iList, that helps students learn linked lists, an important topic in computer science curricula. The two versions of iList differ on the level of feedback they can provide to the students, specifically in the explanation of syntax and execution errors. The system has been fielded in multiple classrooms in two institutions. Our results indicate that iList is effective, is considered interesting and useful by the students, and its performance is getting closer to the performance of human tutors. Moreover, the system is being developed in the context of a study of human tutoring, which is guiding the evolution of iList with empirical evidence of effective tutoring.";

bibo:abstract "This Research Full Paper implements a framework that harness sources of programming learning analytics on three computer programming courses a Higher Education Institution. The platform, called PredictCS, automatically detects lower-performing or “at-risk” students in programming courses and automatically and adaptively sends them feedback. This system has been progressively adopted at the classroom level to improve personalized learning. A visual analytics dashboard is developed and accessible to Faculty. This contains information about the models deployed and insights extracted from student's data. By leveraging historical student data we built predictive models using student characteristics, prior academic history, logged interactions between students and online resources, and students' progress in programming laboratory work. Predictions were generated every week during the semester's classes. In addition, during the second half of the semester, students who opted-in received pseudo real-time personalised feedback. Notifications were personalised based on students' predicted performance on the course and included a programming suggestion from a top-student in the class if any programs submitted had failed to meet the specified criteria. As a result, this helped students who corrected their programs to learn more and reduced the gap between lower and higher-performing students.";

bibo:abstract "The EPCoS project (Effective Projectwork in Computer Science) is working to map the range of project-based learning practices in UK higher education and to generate insights into what characterizes the contexts in which particular techniques are effective. In assembling a body of authentic examples, EPCoS aims to provide a resource that enables extrapolation and synthesis of new techniques. To allow educators and researchers to mine this material, EPCoS is systematizing it within a template-based catalogue, augmented with indexing and abstracting devices. Moreover, EPCoS is examining the process by which practices are transferred between institutional contexts, with a view to identifying effective models of the transfer process. Three key elements of transfer are the identification of appropriate practices, the selection of a practice for a purpose, and the integration of a chosen practice into the existing culture. Structured resources and process models are essential tools for supporting responsiveness in the current climate of continual change: the rapid development of computer technology is demanding new range and flexibility in project work, and EPCoS's mapping of project-based teaching allows practitioners to respond to these changes. This is one context in which educational research into how projects work can generalize to professional practice.";

bibo:abstract "Open source software (OSS) has become mainstream in recent years, making a wide variety of software tools available to instructors and students. In particular, a large collection of OSS source code is now available for use in college courses in disciplines that involve software development. Concomitantly, computer science (CS) educators have been exploring different ways to reinvigorate the CS curriculum to make it more attractive, amenable, and applicable to college students. We regard appropriate OSS use to represent a major prong of a multi-pronged approach to a revamped CS curriculum. Due to our use of OSS in advanced CS courses, our students have gained useful insights into software design and development. They have also felt empowered as they worked on real-world team projects that do not necessarily end with the academic term. This paper uses a database system implementation course to illustrate our approach to OSS and provides an initial assessment";

bibo:abstract "In March 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic imposed “emergency remote teaching” across education globally, leading to a rapid shift to online learning, teaching and assessment (LT&A) across all settings, from schools through to universities. This paper looks specifically at the impact of these disruptive - and ongoing - changes to those teaching the discipline of computer science (CS) across the world. Drawing on the quantitative and qualitative findings from a large-scale international survey (N=2,483) conducted in the immediate aftermath of the shift online between March-April 2020, we report how those teaching CS across all educational settings and contexts (n=327) show significantly more positive attitudes towards the move to online LT&A than those working in other disciplines. When comparing educational setting, CS practitioners in schools felt more prepared and confident than those in higher education; however, they expressed greater concern around equity and whether students would be able to access and meaningfully engage with online LT&A. Furthermore, while CS practitioners across all sectors consistently noted the potential opportunities of these changes, they also raised a number of wider concerns on the impact of this shift to online, especially on workload and job precarity. Concerns were also raised by international CS practitioners regarding the ability to effectively deliver technical topics online, as well as the impact on formal examinations and assessment. This rapid response snapshot of the early impact of COVID-19 on CS education internationally provides insight into emerging LT&A strategies that will likely continue to be constrained by coronavirus into 2021 and beyond.";

bibo:abstract "Students' ratings of teaching quality on course units in a computer science program and an environmental engineering program at a large Swedish university were obtained using the Course Experience Questionnaire; 8888 sets of ratings were obtained from men and 4280 sets were obtained from women over ten academic years. These student ratings from the two programs showed certain differences; in particular, teachers tended to receive higher ratings in subjects that were less typical for their gender than in subjects that were more typical for their gender. There were differences in the ratings given to male and female teachers, differences in the ratings given by male and female students, and interactions between these two effects. There was no systematic trend for students to give different ratings to teachers of the same gender as themselves than to teachers of the other gender. Nevertheless, without exception, even the statistically significant effects were small in magnitude and unlikely to be of theoretical or practical importance. It is concluded that the causes of differences in the career progression of male and female teachers in engineering education need to be sought elsewhere.";

An expert system has been utilized for this purpose. The expert system accepts data related to seven different categories of preparation, belief and attitude and, through the partial activation of multiple rules, predicts an outcome for each student on the post-test (which should correlate with and is used as a surrogate for the student's final course grade). This paper presents two different implementation approaches for the proposed system and then characterizes the performance of the second (chosen) one, demonstrating its suitability for predicting student performance (subject to a level of error).";

dbo:rank "1234";
dblp:bibtexType "Journals";
bibo:abstract "Computational thinking (CT) skills are becoming increasingly relevant for future professionals across all domains, beyond computer science (CS). As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: Research has shown that computer science (CS) students who start programming assignments (PAs) early generally receive higher grades. This article presents and evaluates a gamification approach that utilizes software engineering tools to motivate CS students to start and finish PAs earlier. Background: CS can be difficult to learn because students often struggle with errors and how to properly test their code. For these reasons, it is essential that students start their PAs early. Furthermore, software engineering tools, such as version control and unit testing, are increasingly important for students to learn early in their career. Intended Outcomes: This gamification approach aims to motivate CS students to start and complete PAs earlier, as well as instill software engineering best practices. Application Design: To motivate students to start and finish assignments early, an open-source gamification system called the Leaderboard was developed. Using gamified points, the Leaderboard rewards students who pass PA unit tests well before the assignment is due. The system is fully automated using Github Classroom, a build server, and the Moodle learning management system. Findings: Results indicate students who used the Leaderboard did not start assignments significantly earlier; however, they finished assignments earlier, committed code more frequently, and passed more unit tests. The students found the Leaderboard to be motivating and passing unit tests was exciting for them.";

Though not originally an interview topic, every instructor mentioned ways in which student feedback instigated change. Faculty described several sources of feedback that influence teaching choices, with the goal of trying to improve their teaching. These include formalized evaluations; feedback inferred from student performance; direct requests from students; and students' nonverbal behavior. As sources of evidence for making decisions about teaching practices, each of these is problematic. We describe what makes them problematic and offer solutions described by faculty interviewed.";

bibo:abstract "Research studies have shown the importance of the relationship between “a sense of belonging” and successfully adjusting to college life for undergraduate students. Few studies, however, have compared if native freshmen and transfer students connect to the campus in similar ways. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among participation in social and academic engagement activities, social integration, and academic success for students graduating with engineering or computer science Bachelor's degrees at a large, public university. An additional area of interest was the role of undergraduate research experiences (UREs) in making friends on campus. Using analysis of variance, 1,042 responses were analyzed from senior exit survey questions and cumulative GPA from student records. Students who reported higher levels of social integration on average had higher GPAs. Seven activities were found to be strongly associated with social integration for native freshmen, and three activities for transfer students. Three activities - organizations in their major, experiential learning, and intramural sports - were common to both groups. Surprisingly, given the cohort experience structure of UREs, no significant relationship was found for social integration in this study. This finding may be limited by the sample size or other factors such as self-selection bias.";

bibo:abstract "In the last two decades, there have been studies claiming that science is becoming ever more interdisciplinary. However, the evidence has been anecdotal or partial. Here for the first time, we investigate a large size citation network of computer science domain with the intention to develop an automated unsupervised classification model that can efficiently distinguish the core and the interdisciplinary research fields. For this purpose, we propose four indicative features, three of these are directly related to the topological structure of the citation network, while the fourth is an external indicator based on the attractiveness of a field for the in-coming researchers. The significance of each of these features in characterizing interdisciplinary is measured independently and then systematically accumulated to build an unsupervised classification model. The result of the classification model shows two distinctive clusters that clearly distinguish core and interdisciplinary fields of computer science domain. Based on this classification, we further study the evolution dynamics at a microscopic level to show how interdisciplinarity emerges through cross-fertilization of ideas between the fields that otherwise have little overlap as they are mostly studied independently. Finally, to understand the overall impact of interdisciplinary research on the entire domain, we analyze selective citation based measurements of core and interdisciplinary fields, paper submission and acceptance statistics at top-tier conferences and the core-periphery structure of citation network, and observe an increasing impact of the interdisciplinary fields along with their steady integration with the computer science core in recent times.";

bibo:abstract "This Research Full Paper presents a review of recent studies on SIGCSE about teaching programming (CS1) and data structures (CS2) for university students in computer science courses. Our main contribution is the identification of three categories and their respective subcategories for teaching programming: (i) characterization of contents, (ii) identification of pedagogical strategies and (iii) grouping of support tools. Context: Technology is increasingly more present in modern life. This demands qualified professionals in algorithmic thinking and coding. However, teaching programming is a challenging task, with frequently high dropout and failure rates. Because of this there is a large amount of scientific literature about methods and tools for teaching this topic. A systematic review to compile existing techniques can be very useful for teacher and professionals interested in the area. Objective: The goal of this paper is to identify and discuss the recent approaches used in teaching algorithms and data structures presented in the last five years of SIGCSE. Thus, we investigated the following research question: What are the recent approaches to teaching programming and data structures? Method: We conducted a review of the primary researches published in SIGCSE Technical Symposium during 2014-2018. All primary studies published in this period were evaluated according to the inclusion criteria. The studies related to our objective were completely read, passed through the extraction of data and classified according to the research questions. Results: In the end of the selection phase, 60 papers were used to conduct this research. Our results were classified into three categories: (i) contents were identified in 60 papers. We found that CS1 is predominant, it is present in 76.7% of papers. Whereas the teaching of CS2 is present in only 38.3% of the papers; (ii) teaching strategies were identified in 32 papers. Active learning approaches are usually the target of these studies. It should be noted that pair programming was present in 18.3% of these papers; finally (iii) 28 papers were found about support tools and most of them are focused on visualization and animation. Conclusion: Effective pedagogical approaches for teaching CS1 and CS2 are of great concern for educators around the globe. There is also a need for more tools that support the teaching of these disciplines.";

Electrical Engineering (EE) activities thus \"took over\" and dominated the work of those involved with computing. Once that had been done (around the mid-1950s), the reverse takeover happened: the science of computing then \"took over\" the discipline of EE, in the sense that its theory of digital switches and separation of hardware and software offered EE a guide to designing and building ever more complex circuits.";

It is imperative that any updated curriculum in computer science must include these topics not only as advanced (often elective) programming courses. There is a general consensus that parallel programming topics should be spread throughout the undergraduate curriculum.In this paper we describe how parallel and distributed computing and, specifically concurrent and parallel programming topics, are being included in the updated computer science curriculum of the degree in computer science at the Río Cuarto National University, Argentina. Also, we cover some suggested approaches for teaching parallel programming topics in a set of core courses to achieve a consistent, increasing and complete training in high performance computing. To achieve these goals, we propose a set of modules which includes basic and advanced high performance computing and some parallel and distributed systems programming topics, to be included in core courses. Finally, we describe the use of existing tools and the development of new high level tools, as parallel patterns, useful for teaching parallel programming which can be used in different courses. The aim of using these tools and techniques is to reduce the gap between sequential and parallel programming.";

bibo:abstract "The use of AI assistants, along with the challenges they present, has sparked significant debate within the community of computer science education. While these tools demonstrate the potential to support students' learning and instructors' teaching, they also raise concerns about enabling unethical uses by students. Previous research has suggested various strategies aimed at addressing these issues. However, they concentrate on introductory programming courses and focus on one specific type of problem. The present research evaluated the performance of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art AI assistant, at solving 187 problems spanning three distinct types that were collected from six undergraduate computer science. The selected courses covered different topics and targeted different program levels. We then explored methods to modify these problems to adapt them to ChatGPT's capabilities to reduce potential misuse by students. Finally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 computer science instructors. The aim was to gather their opinions on our problem modification methods, understand their perspectives on the impact of AI assistants on computer science education, and learn their strategies for adapting their courses to leverage these AI capabilities for educational improvement. The results revealed issues ranging from academic fairness to long-term impact on students' mental models. From our results, we derived design implications and recommended tools to help instructors design and create future course material that could more effectively adapt to AI assistants' capabilities.";

With the aim of aiding researchers to better understand the usage, advantages, and limitations of this large amount of resources, this paper empirically investigates the learning preferences and needs of computer science students and professional developers related to the use of online resources for learning. We conducted a survey with 205 participants, having different degrees of formal instruction and professional experience in programming. The survey investigated the participants' learning preferences, information seeking behavior, preferred online resources, and learning needs. The study results reveal a preference for combined visual and auditory learning while indicating written tutorials and official documentation as two of the most popular resources currently used by developers and students. The study also indicates that, although online resources are considered valuable, there is a need for better support for searching and browsing this kind of resources.";

The major scientific goal of the accompanying studies was to investigate the influence of person-centered technology-enhanced courses on the development of team knowledge, skills and attitudes. In these courses, emphasis was put on team projects with authentic tasks selected by students, and on providing a cooperative atmosphere. Studentspsila perceptions were collected in online questionnaires and analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Results indicate that courses had significant effects on the development of team competencies, whereby effects on knowledge and skills were stronger than on attitudes. Courses including reflection were perceived as having stronger impact on team competencies in general than other courses. As expected, sub-skills that were promoted by specific interventions in a course were also perceived as those being most significantly improved as a result of that course.";

We developed and implemented a UTA training scheme designed to foster student-oriented teaching in recitation sessions along with an instrument to gauge the effects of this instruction on a variety of psychometric scales. We report results from a small-scale pilot study at three institutions showing positive effects on teaching-related beliefs and self-efficacy.";

bibo:abstract "In carrying out their capstone projects, students use knowledge and skills acquired throughout their degree program to create a product or provide a technical service. An assigned advisor guides the students and supervises the work, and a committee assesses the projects. This study compares student and staff perceptions of key aspects of completing this type of project, such as project characteristics, student competencies, advisor involvement, and student perceived learning. The primary finding of this study is that the students' expectations differ greatly from those of staff. In particular, students tend to have a better opinion of their project, their competencies, and the supervision received than does the staff. However, advisors and evaluation committees have a similar opinion about projects characteristics. The students' perception of their learning, furthermore, is not always consistent with the grade obtained or student satisfaction. This disagreement suggests the need to more clearly and effectively communicate actual expectations to students and staff.";

dblp:bibtexType "Journals";
bibo:abstract "Contribution: This article presents a research for enhancing the computer science students' perception on the software project management subject. The main objective of this article is double. The first one is to redesign the current course by including new teaching and new learning methods that encourage students to learn the project management competences and skills. The second one is to analyze the satisfaction of the students regarding the new software project management course. The design of the new course has been based on the improvement proposals from the students, which were collected throughout a grounded theory (GT) study during two academic years. Background: Students must be motivated with both the technical and other transversal competencies provided by the different subjects in the computer science curricula. It is not easy to teach a management subject because students do not clearly find the relationship with their studies. However, it is widely accepted that computer science students need to be trained in project management to be able to work at full capacity in the industry. There is not much literature on how to increase the motivation of students in management subjects. Research Question: Which are the causes and consequences of a low level of interest for software project management in computer science studies? Methodology: Two different experiments were carried out. The first one consisted of determining, during two academic years, the main reasons why computer science students do not get to comprehend the need for such this subject in the curricula. From the GT results, a set of innovative actions were introduced in order to redesign the subject. In the second experiment, during the following two academic years, the satisfaction of the students regarding the changes introduced in the course was analyzed. Findings: The first finding was obtained from the GT study conducted. Four causes influencing students to do not give enough importance to software project management, two consequences derived from these causes and three contingencies to potentially mitigate the consequences were identified. The second finding was the corroboration that the new course design contributes to student motivation and engagement. Through the evaluation of the new course, students can better understand project management techniques and their application to projects. Data collected show that students are aware of the importance of these skills and competencies for their background and professional profile.";

We've devised an active learning classroom model which incorporates reflection at multiple points in students' learning experience. This active learning model adopts Kolb's Learning model to provide a coherent and connected set of activities before, during, and after the class. Unlike periodic assessment through testing, reflections can provide nearly-real-time information about student's experiences in class. We extract sentiment feature vectors to capture students' affect from written reflections. These features typically aren't assessed on tests or during in-class activities. These features were extracted automatically using LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) is a tool for applied natural language processing) which is less cumbersome to implement than manually reading the written reflections. We find that using these sentiment feature vectors extracted from the reflections in our learning model increased accuracy while decreasing time-to-detect at-risk students significantly.";

This paper presents the continuum in evolution of a hardware based course “Microprocessors and Microcontrollers” in a software oriented curriculum. It presents the improvements realized in hands-on laboratory exercises and new teaching methodology for them. The results show that realized changes have improved the quality of grade distribution even more, and not only in hands-on lab exercises, but also in mandatory practical projects and course overall grade distribution.";

However, a majority of the literature fails to represent African-American females in research studies. The purpose of this study is to understand the factors that influence the attitudes of African-American middle school girls toward computer science. The results reveal that the African-American middle school girls in the sample generally have negative attitudes toward computer science. However, after participating in a computer science intervention, perceptions become more positive due to four factors: engaging in the intervention, the intervention content domain, the facilitation of performance accomplishments, and participant characteristics.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This paper shows how significantly computer science instructors can disagree when grading code writing questions in introductory computer science (CS1) exams. Certain solutions are considered “very good” by some instructors and “very bad” by others. The study identifies four factors as possible contributors to such differences between graders: 1) disagreement on the role of syntax in CS1; 2) absence of objective measures for the seriousness of logic errors; 3) variance in how rubrics are constructed; and 4) the use of subjective judgement while grading. Background: Code writing questions are widely used in CS1 exams. Understanding differences in how graders approach such questions can help the CS education community become more informed about how to design valid assessments for summative and formative purposes. Research Questions: Do graders differ significantly in how they score student programs? What are the main factors to which differences between graders could be attributed? Methodology: A number of CS1 instructors and TAs were asked to score pieces of code resembling student solutions to CS1 exam questions, and were asked to answer open ended questions on how they approach grading in CS1 exams. Responses were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings: There is no consensus on how code writing questions in CS1 exams should be graded. Differences in opinion on how many points to award can be very significant, even for very simple programs and between graders in the same institution. Some graders assign grades that do not necessarily agree with how many points they believe the student solution is worth.";

A first draft for the virtual reality aims to immerse students in a world of islands (states) with treasure islands (final states). Each symbol from the input alphabet is illustrated through another boat on every island. Students navigate through the islands by looking at one of the boats on the current island using a head-mounted-display. They then take the shipping route of the selected boat (the state-transition function) by pressing a button on a controller. The goal of the game can either be to reach Treasure Island and open the treasure chest or to complete the map.";

Online contract cheating services are not only easily accessible but, most importantly, highly affordable.We report on a case study investigating how students use one particular online tutoring company to purchase solutions to their computer science assignments. Taking the perspective of a typical student, we uploaded several assignment questions and solicited solutions, looking at factors such as quality and time taken to procure the answers, and the tutoring company's diligence in acting on clear violations of their own honor code.The results show that purchasing solutions for homework questions is both easy and cheap. Solutions for questions at CS1 and CS2 levels appear to be of good quality and are delivered within short time frames. Even though the questions had clear cues to indicate that the student was trying to buy answers for a current assessed activity, the questions were neither identified nor flagged as violations of academic integrity anywhere in the process.We discuss potential measures that might counter contract cheating and conclude that a multi-pronged approach may be necessary for effective mitigation.";

Good feedback to students helps closing the gap between actual and desired performance. In this paper we analyze how to introduce online adaptive formative learning in Computer Science, a discipline with well documented challenges that are hard to tackle with traditional classroom methods. Specifically, we developed illustrative learning items teaching Model-Driven Design and implemented them in an online system that implements a model for automatic formative assessment developed by University of Torino. The model takes advantage of an automatic assessment system initially designed for STEM disciplines, then adopted for teaching languages and other disciplines too. The key features of the adaptive model supported by the online system are algorithmic questions, availability, contextualization, immediate feedback, interactive feedback, and open answers. These features are portable across subject domains, so the system can be adapted to include new subjects. We chose MDD because it is a topic of Computer Science education connected with Computational Thinking, software design, and formal methods, which are three of the core areas in need of enhanced support.";

bibo:abstract "Game-based learning environments can deliver robust learning gains and also have a unique capacity to engage students. Yet they can unintentionally disadvantage students with less prior gaming experience. This is especially concerning in computer science education, as certain underrepresented groups (such as female students) may on average have less prior experience with games. This paper presents evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach can successfully address this problem at the middle school level. In an iterative, designed-based research study, we first used an experimental pilot study to investigate the nature of collaboration in the Engage game-based learning environment, and then deployed Engage in a full classroom study to measure its effectiveness at serving all students. In earlier phases of the intervention, male students outpaced their female peers in learning gains. However, female students caught up during a multi-week classroom implementation. These findings provide evidence that a collaborative gameplay approach may, over time, compensate for gender differences in experience and lead to equitable learning experiences within game-based learning environments for computer science education.";

bibo:abstract "The \"Girls on the Go: The Mobile Computing College Experience\" is a residential summer camp whose aim is to encourage female high school students to attend college, to consider computer science as viable major, and to pursue computing related degrees. The camp content is designed primarily around a user-centered design process, with the students gaining experience in the development of a zoo-themed mobile app. In addition to technical experience, students participate in sessions that educate them on campus life, the admissions process, and more importantly, what a computing-related career may hold for them. The camp was offered in two consecutive summers, with approximately 20 participants in each iteration. In this paper, we compare differences between the two iterations with the intent of identifying both lessons learned and avenues for improving the experience. We investigate whether the camp had an effect on attitudes towards computer science as a major, and on the careers available to computer science graduates. To this end, our analysis revealed a statistically significant effect upon raising awareness of the role of computer scientists and the relevancy of computing for solving real world problems.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This article details a systematic study to investigate knowledge that graduate students have about reliability and safety engineering (RSE), comparing it with industry expectations. Background: Reliability and safety have always been the main focus while developing safety-critical systems (SCS). An interview study was conducted with engineering students in India and Brazil and with experienced practitioners to investigate a perceived mismatch between education and employment on knowledge related to RSE in SCS. Research Question: How does student knowledge of RSE for SCS compare with industry expectations? What measures could be taken by institutes and universities providing computer engineering courses to better meet the expectations of industries regarding SCS? Methodology: Interviews and discussions were conducted with 21 practitioners from ten different organizations to identify what expectations they hold for the students they recruit to develop SCS, as these SCS have high reliability and safety requirements. Interviews were conducted with graduate students of various engineering disciplines to assess their knowledge of RSE for SCS. Analyses were conducted to compare industry expectations with students’ knowledge. Findings: Analyses indicated most graduate students do not have the range of knowledge regarding RSE that recruiters see as essential for the development of SCS. Hence, it is paramount to rethink computing curricula—to include RSE-related topics.";

bibo:abstract "This work-in-progress research paper uses multiple regression of both cognitive and non-cognitive factors to model current GPA of engineering and computer science students. High school GPA and ACT/SAT scores are among the most common scores used as admission criteria, which result in a relatively homogeneous engineering population. Prior research, however, shows that these scores do not account for the variance in GPA once these students start undergraduate studies. In this work, we explore how students' cognitive (e.g., study skills, test performance, regulatory behaviors, etc.) and non-cognitive factors (e.g., identity, motivation, personality, etc.) predict student success in their engineering pathways. The data for this initial study comes from a pilot survey, deployed in the summer of 2017, of 490 engineering and computing students from two large, public institutions, one on the West Coast, the other in the Midwest. We used multiple linear regression to control for demographic variables while examining the predictive value of particular cognitive and non-cognitive factors for student academic achievement (i.e., GPA) in university. Our analysis shows, not surprisingly, that standardized test scores only explain a small portion of the variance of undergraduate GPA. Including non-cognitive and affective factors into a regression model produced a marked increase in the explained variance. Our work is novel in examining a constellation of possible factors that predict undergraduate student GPA, by combining both cognitive and non-cognitive factors as predictors. This analysis begins to unpack particular factors that have potential to predict GPA of engineering and computer science students.";

bibo:abstract "Study of community in time-varying graphs has been limited to its detection and identification across time. However, presence of time provides us with the opportunity to analyze the interaction patterns of the communities, understand how each individual community grows/shrinks, becomes important over time. This paper, for the first time, systematically studies the temporal interaction patterns of communities using a large scale citation network (directed and unweighted) of computer science. Each individual community in a citation network is naturally defined by a research field - i.e., acting as ground-truth - and their interactions through citations in real time can unfold the landscape of dynamic research trends in the computer science domain over the last fifty years. These interactions are quantified in terms of a metric called inwardness that captures the effect of local citations to express the degree of authoritativeness of a community (research field) at a particular time instance. Several arguments to unveil the reasons behind the temporal changes of inwardness of different communities are put forward using exhaustive statistical analysis. The measurements (importance of field) are compared with the project funding statistics of NSF and it is found that the two are in sync. We believe that this measurement study with a large real-world data is an important initial step towards understanding the dynamics of cluster-interactions in a temporal environment. Note that this paper, for the first time, systematically outlines a new avenue of research that one can practice post community detection.";

Yes, there is. This article describes a first course for nonmajors that covers a surprisingly broad set of topics in substantial depth. Advances in teaching methods involving an appropriate selection of topics, proper coverage of those topics, and the use of animated simulations can significantly ease the teaching of computer science to nonspecialists. The course described enables students to develop skill in programming, learn the fundamental mechanisms of computer hardware and software, and gain a substantial understanding of important topics such as computational intractability, noncomputability, parallel architectures, and artificial intelligence.<>";

bibo:abstract "The computer science discipline, especially in large scale distributed systems like grids and P2P systems and in high performance computing areas, tends to address issues related to increasingly complex systems, gathering thousands to millions of non trivial components. Theoretical analysis, simulation and even emulation are reaching their limits. Like in other scientific disciplines such as physics, chemistry and life science, there is a need to develop, run and maintain generations of scientific instruments for the observation of complex distributed systems running at real scale and under reproducible experimental conditions. Grid'5000 and DAS3 are two large scale systems designed as scientific instruments for researchers in the domains of grid, P2P and networking. More than testbeds, Grid'5000 and DAS3 have been designed as \"computer science grids\", where researchers share experimental resources spanning over large geographical distances, are able to reserve resources, configure them, run their experiments, realize precise measurements and replay the same experiments with the same experimental conditions. Computer scientists use these two platforms to address issues in the different software layers between the hardware and the users: networking protocols, OS, middleware, parallel and distributed application runtimes, and applications. In this paper, we will present two computer science grids: Grid '5000 and DAS3. We will describe the motivations, design and current status of these two systems. We will also present some of their key results, not only in terms of scientific results in computer science, but also the impact of these two systems as research tools. The success of the Grid'5000 and DAS platforms is the basis of an international initiative, having the objective to deploy a European level \"computer science grid\".";

In addition, the students filled in a survey after each training session, which measured the number of completed exercises and the level of experienced difficulty of the exercises. The study reveals that in the computer science classes typical gender distribution (majority male) lowers the comfort level of all students in comparison to a case with an even gender distribution. In light of this research, the study presents, that both male and female students would benefit, if more women studied computer science";

bibo:abstract "Computational Thinking (CT) introduces computing concepts and demonstrates their usefulness in many other disciplines. CT principles such as algorithmic problem solving, abstraction, modeling and simulation, are integrated into existing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) curricula by DISSECT (DIScover SciEnce through Computational Thinking). By pairing a local K-12 teacher with a graduate fellow, DISSECT provides instruction and resources as instruments that are pertinent to each specific discipline. These skills in problem-solving and abstract reasoning are necessary for students to be able to compete in the modern and future job markets. DISSECT works to provide these skill-sets to students and classrooms that lack access to computers. The K-12 teachers and graduate fellows work together to develop modules that are capable of teaching CT concepts that are directly tied to their current curriculum while removing the need for access to computer systems. This paper will focus on the modules developed and executed in middle and high school classrooms, emphasizing the creative ways explored to operate in a computer-free environment discussing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, while qualitatively assessing student engagement, learning, and interaction which is gathered through teacher interviews, observations and informal talks with students.";

bibo:abstract "Violence against women and children is a public health issue of pandemic proportions. It is estimated that one in every three women worldwide has experienced physical, emotional, or sexual violence. Similarly, each year one out of two children are victims of some form of violence including domestic aggression and bullying. Due to the widespread use of the Internet and social media, women and children are now vulnerable to other types of violence such as cyber-bullying and online sexual or emotional harassment. To help alleviate this social problem, the use of computer science and related technologies has been leveraged in recent years. The Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, ubiquitous and mobile computing, pattern recognition, cloud computing and similar technologies, have been used to formulate solutions to detect and prevent violent acts against women and children. In this paper, a systematic review of some of the efforts that can help address the problem of violence against women and children is presented. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art of these contributions and identifies trends, architectures, technologies, and current open challenges. The survey was developed using a literature review of academic documents published from 2010 to 2020. The contributions were categorized into four application domains: online detection, offline detection, safety, and education. These contributions were further categorized based on the computer science approaches and technologies used: artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and digital serious games.";

bibo:abstract "Data structures course is the most essential and critical course for computing-related majors. In this course, data structures, their main differences, and their usages are explained. However, for computer science students and especially students who do not have programming experiences, learning data structures can be challenging, and many students change their majors if they are not successful in this course. Given the importance of data structures, it is a pressing issue that we need to work to meet student needs and improve computer science education in this area. With technological developments, teaching strategies based on technology are also varying. The student performance is improved at various levels with these strategies. Also, accessing lower price smart devices with lower prices makes previously inaccessible technology, like Augmented Reality (AR), more readily available for students. Therefore, in this paper, we have developed a practice and learning environment for students based on AR and compared AR approach with standard and web-based animation approaches according to students' comments. Results show that the AR approach not only helps students learn data structures better but is also found to be the most exciting approach.

bibo:abstract "Proper development of Computer Science analytical programming skills requires rigorous practice sessions with problem sets and coding exercises, but this is often not apriority for many students. Digital educational games have been shown to increase the appeal of repetitive instructional tasks however many of these games fail to capitalize on the power of cultural motivators. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach towards game design, a culturally-enriched approach that deliberately plays up the strengths of culture as a motivational trigger and instructional stimulant. The research presented illustrates how powerful motivational hooks were created in an educational gaming environment for developing analytical programming skills through subtle, careful use of cultural elements. An experiment conducted using the game revealed modest gains in the debugging skills of 77% of the student participants, and a strong relationship between length of game play and increase in analytical skill. Furthermore, a strong relationship was found linking the degree of cultural game feedback to positive student affect towards programming exercises thereby validating the utility of our approach.";

bibo:abstract "Due to the pervasive presence of parallel and distributed computing (PDC) in most of the application domains, the need for PDC skills in computing professionals is necessary. This has inspired much interest in including PDC topics in existing computer science (CS) undergraduate curriculum, as evidenced in the ACM/IEEE joint curriculum recommendations. We address this gap by developing new active learning style PDC activities. The application and evaluation of the unplugged activities are described in this paper. The activities highlight key benefits of parallel computing, and the appropriate application of important PDC concepts. An assessment of student engagement has been utilized to measure the effectiveness of our active learning PDC modules. We determine whether the engagement differs by gender, age, and class standing (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). Results indicated there were slight differences with respect to age and class standing. This research contributes to helping other practitioners in the CS community by providing PDC lesson modules to be integrated into their existing courses. The developed activities and the related lesson plans are intended to provide easier learning of the fundamental PDC concepts in an early undergraduate CS curriculum.";

bibo:abstract "Popular problems of Computer Science Education that are often solved using algorithms include various number sorting tasks. Sorting algorithms have the potential to emphasize powerful programming paradigms and also to start discussions about algorithm complexity. Research has shown that hands-on activities using analogies and fun activities instead of programming tasks can foster learning in this area in many different ways. In times when much teaching and learning takes place online, the implementing of such unplugged activities can become difficult. Visualizations and animations can help to achieve learning outcomes by making these relatively abstract phenomena more concrete. In particular, virtual reality environments can provide new forms for interacting with visualizations and might well foster motivational, emotional, and perceptual factors that have an influence on learning processes. This paper investigates the differences between these subjective variables in a web application and a VR application for learning sorting algorithms. The results produced initial indicators that learners experience higher presence, absorption, flow, psychological immersion and positive emotions in a virtual reality setting compared to a desktop setting.";

The program uses a constructivist pedagogical approach allowing students to build their understanding of computer science and technology through Internet-search-based history lessons, podcasts, and presentations by other black male tech entrepreneurs. Additionally, students ventured out into their community with hands-on design-thinking and customer discovery skills to observe their environment, its issues/problems, and developed new technology with their unique perspectives in mind. Results showed that participants became interested and confident in computer science by creating their own tech innovations.";

What are students' learning experiences, how do these affect their attitudes towards learning CS? This question was explored by investigating diverse students, of a broad study program with courses in humanities and technology, at the end of an introductory course in CS (CS1), which has been designed to enhance students' engagement. The results of a first questionnaire were remarkably positive: All students reflected their experiences as overall positive. Almost half of the students stated, that they had been skeptical towards learning CS before the course. All of these students described positive transformations of attitudes. These results provided an interesting starting point for further research using interviews: What exactly have these students experienced and how do they reason about future engagement? We point out students' experiences that were crucial for a positive transformation of attitudes as well as critical aspects in students' reasoning on future engagement in CS.";

In addition to an improved attitude and stated increased satisfaction, students' test results seemed to show increased comprehension and improved critical reasoning abilities. However, the authors felt the need to further evaluate their experiments for a more objective assessment. As an initial step, the authors conducted a survey of CSUN graduates, now working professionals.

Second, the students participated in a traditional exercise session, in which the new techniques were practised in details. And third, the students kept a learning diary, in which they processed the subjects further, tried to construct an overall schema of things learnt, and supervised their own learning. The results were really successful: the students committed themselves well and the drop out percentage was very small; they achieved very deep understanding of the subjects measured by their grades and quality of learning diaries; the experience was enjoyable for both the students and the teachers; and finally, the method supported different kinds of learners very well.";

bibo:abstract "This Innovative Practice Full Paper explores the diversity of challenges relating to the teaching of cybersecurity in UK higher education degree programmes, through the lens of national policy, to the impact on pedagogy and practice. There is a serious demand for cybersecurity specialists, both in the UK and globally; there is thus significant and growing higher education provision related to specialist undergraduate and postgraduate courses focusing on varying aspects of cybersecurity. To make our digital systems and products more secure, all in IT need to know some cybersecurity - thus, there is a case for depth as well as breadth; this is not a new concern, but it is a growing one. Delivering cybersecurity effectively across general computer science programmes presents a number of challenges related to pedagogy, resources, faculty and infrastructure, as well as responding to industry requirements. Computer science and cognate engineering disciplines are evolving to meet these demands - both at school-level, as well as at university - however, doing so is not without challenges. This paper explores the progress made to date in the UK, building on previous work in cybersecurity education and accreditation by highlighting key challenges and opportunities, as well as identifying a number of enhancement activities for use by the international cybersecurity education community. It frames these challenges through concerns with the quality and availability of underpinning educational resources, the competencies and skills of faculty (especially focusing on pedagogy, progression and assessment), and articulating the necessary technical resources and infrastructure related to delivering rigorous cybersecurity content in general computer science and cognate degrees. Though this critical evaluation of an emerging national case study of cybersecurity education in the UK, we also present a number of recommendations across policy and practice - from pedagogic principles and developing effective cybersecurity teaching practice, challenges in the recruitment, retention and professional development of faculty, to supporting diverse routes into post-compulsory cybersecurity education (and thus, diverse careers) - to provide the foundation for potential replicability and portability to other jurisdictions contemplating related education and skills reform initiatives and interventions.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: Internships designed to provide training and an initial period of contact with industry, prior to a computer science engineering capstone project, have a very positive impact on both industry and academic capstone projects. Background: Internships and capstone projects are widely used to integrate work-related learning in computer engineering curricula. Both activities offer numerous benefits for students, industry, and academia. Although their effects have been extensively studied separately, the interaction between them remains unexplored. Research Questions: What is the effect of internships on the development of a subsequent capstone project? Methodology: The hypothesis was that the completion of an internship will have positive effects on several aspects of the capstone projects: 1) improved student competencies; 2) improved capstone project outcomes; and 3) decreased supervision effort. Further, these positive effects were expected to be greater in industry-based projects than in academic projects. The hypothesis was tested through a quantitative study of data collected from 274 computer science engineering capstone projects. A period of time with internships was compared with another period without internships, and differentiating between academic and industry projects. Findings: Internships prior to capstone projects improve student skills in autonomy, technology, methodology, and project management; increase the complexity and technological novelty of the resulting projects; and reduce advisor involvement in practical (technology, execution) and keep-the-project-alive issues, and increase advisor involvement in monitoring student work (meetings, reports, and initial arrangements). This effect was observed in both industrial and academic projects.";

bibo:abstract "Based on the didactical concept that was developed to integrate a robot-platform into teaching and learning of Computer Science in engineering courses at the university of Applied Sciences Aschaffenburg the Lego Mindsorms EV3 [1] robots were integrated into the practical lessons. In these Computer Science lessons the students (Bachelor of Engineering) learn the programming-language ANSI C. To program the robots in this language a dedicated toolchain [2] was developed. A major problem that was mentioned many times in a regular semester evaluation, after integrating the EV3, is the fact that the students cannot use the robots outside of the laboratory. So they are not able to learn and program the EV3 independently from the laboratory opening hours and practical lessons. To solve this problem and improve the success with this platform, it will now be analysed if a simulation could advance the process of deepening the learned skills in practical and theoretical computer science lessons. Also a concept for the realisation of such a simulation will be shown. This will be done based on the developed didactical concept for integrating a robot-platform in teaching and learning of Computer Science in engineering courses [3].";

bibo:abstract "For graduates in computer science and informatics to get employment as IT professionals, there is a need for their education to provide the competence sought after by employers. To become fully operational in the organization, the candidates typically also need to develop their competence there. For a university offering master’s degrees in computer science and informatics, it is important to know the employers’ view of the relevance of the study programs and what is possibly considered to be lacking. Also, it is essential to know whether the missing part needed to become fully operational should be provided by the university. In this paper, we investigate these questions by asking employers of master students in IT. A combination of in-depth interviews and a survey is used. Analysis of the findings shows that employers overall find the candidates’ competence to be adequate and that the time needed for in-house training is acceptable. We argue that collaboration between university and industry is essential to this success, pointing to a set of key steps in the process from entering a study program to becoming fully operational in work life.";

Has been considered 152 study subjects, who are a representative sample, all of them use mobile devices in their daily lives, even during their stay in the University. An instrument was designed to survey: the 152 individuals, among which were interviewed: i) teachers, from the eight knowledge areas that compose the academies; ii) the computer labs managers; and iii) the school control department administrators. All the individuals interviewed, students, teachers and administrative staff, felt that mobile technology is the source of improvement of students qualifications and their academic performance. The reasons exposed by them agreed in the availability of access to Internet, ease of communication with teachers, classmates and the motivation to use a mobile device connected to the Internet. Interesting, from the 152 respondents, 86% say they use their smart phone or tablet to play, but most of them also used as support in their learning, and the 79% of these fellows would like to be implemented officially mobile technology as a means of learning in the University.";

bibo:abstract "The CS for All Movement is making great strides toward increasing access to quality computer science (CS) education, particularly for minoritized youth from communities historically underrepresented in computing fields. However, it can be both mentally and emotionally challenging to enter fields of expertise where people do not look like you, and where your culture and experiences are seen as foreign or “different.” If we want to see students engaging with computing in their varying academic/career pathways, they must feel a sense of belonging and “rightful presence” in computing classrooms [1]. In an effort to prioritize students' voices and ideas about what matters most for their sense of belonging in CS, this study administered end-of-year surveys to 860 students across Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles classrooms in a large west coast urban school district serving majority low-income students of color. This study describes students' levels of engagement with CS, whether or not they identify as “computer science people,” and the factors impacting their sense of belonging with the field. These findings will be important to consider when shaping both curricula and professional development opportunities geared at broadening participation in computing, by informing ways to support students' sense of belonging and engagement with computing.";

Our extensive review of the NECC (National Educational Computing Conference) and SIGCSE (Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education) conference proceedings from 1979 to 1998 clearly shows a decline in the number of articles in which programming is taught in CS-0 courses. Furthermore, based upon learning theory literature, we argue that conceptual understanding of computing can be acquired without learning to program. Finally, we describe our criterion-referenced, mastery-model course that prepares 1800 students per semester for a computing future that is constantly changing.";

bibo:abstract "Literature review is a fundamental part of a research process, and systematic protocols for this activity have been used for a long time, mainly in the field of health. Specifically in the Computer Science Education area, the use of systematic literature review has grown. One of the steps in a systematic literature review (SLR) is the selection of academic databases in which to search for articles. There are several databases with academic documents that may be relevant to SLR, for example: Google Scholar, which indexes different types of documents, such as articles, dissertations, theses, and others; Scopus and Web of Science are large databases that index articles from different conferences and journals. ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore are also important sources of information in the field of Computer Education. These tools have different characteristics, some charge a fee, others have only information about the title and authors and do not have access to the full article, others have advanced features, with many filters. In this context, this article presents the following research questions: RQ1) What metadata can be extracted automatically from the databases?; RQ2) What kind of visualization tools are available?; RQ3) Do the documents returned by the databases cover the research topic?; RQ4) Do the databases have papers from the main CSE venues?; and RQ5) How many databases are required to perform a literature review in CSE? To answer these questions we used five academic databases: Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE xplore. Regarding the results, Scopus and Web of Science have the best visualization of the documents and a robust query engine, however those academic databases are not free. ACM Digital library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus and Web of Science allow the automatic download of the papers’ metadata (author, title, abstract, affiliation and others). Specifically in the field of Computer Science Education, the ACM Digital Library and the IEEE Xplore have important papers from conferences (SIGCSE and FIE) and journals (ACM Transaction on Education and IEEE Transaction on Education). In this full paper, the results will be presented to help researchers to choose the most appropriate academic databases based on their requirements and available options.";

bibo:abstract "The present work is focused on studying two issues: the “teamwork” generic competence and the “academic motivation”. Currently the professional profile of engineers has a strong component of teamwork. On the other hand, motivational profile of students determines their tendencies when they come to work in team, as well as their performance at work. In this context we suggest four hypotheses: (H1) students improve their teamwork capacity by specific training and carrying out a set of activities integrated into an active learning process; (H2) students with higher mastery motivation have better attitude towards team working; (H3) students with higher mastery motivation obtain better results in academic performance; and (H4) students show different motivation profiles in different circumstances: type of courses, teaching methodologies, different times of the learning process. This study was carried out with computer science engineering students from two Spanish universities. The first results point to an improvement in teamwork competence of students if they have previously received specific training in facets of that competence. Other results indicate that there is a correlation between the motivational profiles of students and their perception about teamwork competence. Finally, and contrary to the initial hypothesis, these profiles appear to not influence significantly the academic performance of students.";

Since then, many scholars from several scientific fields have continued to enhance, develop, and interpret the data. This study describes the concept of entropy and its applications to information theory, queuing theory, engineering systems, computing, and statistical mechanics. The choice of these applications was subjected to the size limitation of the paper. Having said that, entropy has a great applicability to other scientific disciplines. Even more interesting is the nature of entropy as a measurement of uncertainty, dis-order, or turbulence was the main core of attraction to a considerable number of scholars in all academic areas of research expertise to both employ it and make a significant research advancement. Its goal is to present a coherent picture of how classical entropies might be used in engineering and computer science. It is attempted to create a concise exposition that strikes a balance between conceptual importance and instrumental relevance. A representative list of references closes this review.";

We begin by exploring the meaning of the term, and review representative examples of Entrepreneurship programs in different Computer Science departments, looking at their stated goals and outcomes. We then describe our own experience designing and teaching a new, two-part, yearlong course on “Software Entrepreneurship” at Brandeis University, we extensively explore important lessons learned from this experience. Our program includes two interlocking courses, one focused on the “discovery stage” and one focused on the “delivery stage”. We briefly describe the structure, learning objectives and overall flow of the courses. We then examine, in turn, a series of common challenges and our solutions and innovations in each: a) forming well-functioning student teams; b) choosing the appropriate size of teams; c) catalyzing innovation in the student teams; d) encouraging positive team dynamics and dealing with crises; e) defining the final deliverable; and f) deploying outside experts and g) assessments at the end of the course. To get a handle on the effectiveness of our approach we present a selection of student written reflections on their experience, how they felt it impacted them, and to what extent they see entrepreneurship in their own future. We conclude by identifying two broad areas for future work and study.";

dblp:publishedBy "IEEE";
dbo:rank "1311";
dblp:bibtexType "Journals";
bibo:abstract "Problem: This teaching case presents the authors' experience planning, teaching, and evaluating a semester-long course within a computer science undergraduate program; the aim of this course was to develop soft skills that enable students to actively contribute within multicultural and transdisciplinary teams. Research question: How can an undergraduate-level course help computer science students better understand the multicultural and interdisciplinary scenarios that compose today's working environment? Situating the case: The literature review contextualizes the case as part of a broader group of literature concerned with curricular reforms that replace the traditional emphasis on memorization of fixed disciplinary knowledge with what have been called “21st Century Skills.” In addition, it builds a theoretical framework followed by the course that brings together Hofstede's Cultural Theory and Vygotsky's ideas regarding the social formation of the mind. Methodology: The researchers conducted two studies with a group of 62 students who participated in the course. The first one measured how students appropriated the concepts presented in the course and learning outcomes. The second one evaluated the students' perception of the course a year after they had enrolled in it. About the teaching case: Results show that the vast majority of students appropriate the concepts of the theoretical framework used throughout the course. In addition, most students perceive the courses' contribution to their professional lives positively—particularly regarding understanding cultural and transdisciplinary issues. A small group does not consider a course like the one proposed to be useful. Conclusions: The implication of this teaching case is that the ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences is something that can be addressed directly by a specifically designed course within a computer science curriculum (rather than exclusively being a secondary outcome of other courses). The limitations of the study are that it presents the authors' own teaching experience (therefore, it is not a third-party report) and that it uses pretesting and posttesting as an asessment tool for multicultural and transdisciplinary abilities. Future work would show how similar experiences could be conducted across other cultural scenarios and possible ways in which to engage the small group of students who do not consider the course useful.";

bibo:abstract "The utilization of large-scale group projects in early computer science courses has been readily accepted in academia. In these types of projects, students are given a specific portion of a large programming problem to design and develop. Ultimately, the consolidation of all of the independent student projects integrates to form the solution for the large-scale project. Although many studies report on the experience of executing a semester-long course of this nature, course experience at Georgetown University, Washington, DC, shows the benefits of embedding a large-scale project that comprises just a segment of the course (three to four weeks). The success of these types of courses requires an effective process for creating the specific large-scale project. An effective process for large-scale group project course development is applied to the second computer science course at Georgetown University.";

bibo:abstract "Students’ participation and motivation are of great importance in their learning process. The decrease in attendance and difficulties in stimulating students’ activity makes it necessary to find new methodologies that can solve these problems. The use of game mechanics in non-ludic environments (Gamification) has begun to be of great interest in research, since it could increase the motivation and therefore the activity of the students. This study tries to verify if there is an existing relationship between gamification and a possible increase in student activity or between the cessation of gamification and student activity. In addition, it evaluates whether a greater student activity corresponds to a greater learning improvement. In the obtained results, no significant differences were found between the methodology or the activity with a learning improvement. According to the study, the simple use of gamified elements does not necessarily imply a solution to the problems posed. The students’ activity in a course of these characteristics does not imply a better learning improvement, the importance lies in the quality of the activity generated and not in the quantity.";

The work presented here is based on a retrospective process of four coaches who, during the academic year 2002-2003, coached and guided students in the development of software projects within the framework of eXtreme programming. The rationale for this work stems from the fact that software engineering methods are difficult to implement, even in the academia. eXtreme programming, one of the agile software development methods, specifies technical and social guidelines to be followed by software developers during the entire process of software development. As illustrated, these guidelines create a suitable framework for coaching student software projects, as well as for training the coaches themselves for the coaching task.";

The concept of such an extensible “instrument” arose within a larger translational research vision applying computer science and engineering research for the multidimensional benefit of people and communities in cities. The AoT project hypothesized that wireless intelligent sensor networks could enable both quantitative social science and urban monitoring while also stimulating youth interest in science and technology. Successful deployment of such sensor networks could provide open data from urban measurements not only in support of diverse research questions—in environmental dynamics, urban architecture, engineering, and social sciences—but also informing community groups and city planners. The AoT project and its successor SAGE project are a computer science and engineering experiment, but its success is inextricably tied to community engagement and experiential education. Simply put, community acceptance is a prerequisite to installing and testing the instrument.";

The latter is particularly important in Engineering disciplines because the contents to be learnt are especially complex and many students end up having a low performance that leads them to absenteeism and drop out. The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) provides several recommendations related to the academic context (ongoing assessment, mentoring processes and active learning methods among others) that seem to have a positive impact on the students’ motivation. However, these cannot always be implemented due to the high number of students per class existing at many Universities. This contribution presents an empirical case study performed with 149 Computer Science students of a University organized around small groups and innovative educational methodologies. The benefits and outcomes of this academic conditions, as well as their impact in the students’ motivation, are analyzed and discussed.";

bibo:abstract "We propose a system of three principles of public dissemination, which we call reproducibility, correctness, and buildability, and make the argument that consideration of these principles is a necessary step when publicly disseminating results in any evidence-based scientific or engineering endeavor. We examine how these principles apply to the release and disclosure of the four elements associated with computer science research: theory, algorithms, code, and data. Reproducibility refers to the capability to reproduce fundamental results from released details. Correctness refers to the ability of an independent reviewer to verify and validate the results of a paper. We introduce the new term buildability to indicate the ability of other researchers to use the published research as a foundation for their own new work. This is more broad than extensibility, as it requires that the published results have reached a level of completeness that the research can be used for its stated purpose, and has progressed beyond the level of a preliminary idea. We argue that these three principles are not being sufficiently met by current publications and proposals in computer science and engineering, and represent a goal for which publishing should continue to aim. We introduce standards for the evaluation of reproducibility, correctness, and buildability in relation to the varied elements of computer science research and discuss how they apply to proposals, workshops, conferences, and journal publications, making arguments for appropriate standards of each principle in these settings. We address modern issues including big data, data confidentiality, privacy, security, and privilege. Our examination raises questions for discussion in the community on the appropriateness of publishing works that fail to meet one, some, or all of the stated principles.";

dbo:rank "1319";
dblp:bibtexType "Journals";
bibo:abstract "Every day, more people are interested in learning computer science (CS), either to improve their skill set to apply for new jobs or just for personal growth. The sector of the population looking for instruction on these subjects has increased and diversified. We need new tools that appeal to this wider audience, and game-based learning is one of the most promising approaches at the moment. There is a need for more scalable game-based instruction paradigms that can be easily adapted to different levels of complexity and content related to CS (different programming languages, different programming paradigms, and so on). Throughout this paper, we present a flexible and scalable architecture to create videogames for learning CS languages. The architecture is based on the idea that students control the game using small pieces of text written in some CS language. The keys of the scalability of our approach are: 1) it separates the CS language used to write the programs from the game design and 2) the game model provides a system of levels that allows incremental learning of CS language structures. As validation and implementation of our approach, we developed Lost in Space, an educational videogame to teach the XML markup language. In this game, the player travels through several levels, guiding a spaceship by introducing small pieces of XML in a text console. Players can move and rotate the ship among other power-ups that get unblocked as they advances in the game. The game was tested with undergraduate students from CS and social sciences, by comparing it with traditional instruction (i.e., a teacher with a slides presentation). Students who played the game were much more engaged than those who attended the lecture, showing a more active attitude throughout the whole experience and also spent more time practicing after class. Findings also suggest that the game was effective for instruction, regardless of the background of the students. However, the educational gain observed with the game-based instructional approach, although effective, was not significantly higher than traditional instruction. We think that our approach is adequate to introduce CS languages in general, as well as new programming languages, and seems to be more appealing to new comers than traditional instruction.";

bibo:abstract "For university students, a syllabus gives fundamental information about a course, and is important for choosing a course. However, it is not an easy task for students to grasp the topics actually covered by a course syllabus because they have only little knowledge about topic words in the syllabus before they learn the course. We have been studying on a machine learning method of systematically analyzing syllabi by standard curricular guidelines such as “Computing Science Curricula CS2013,” which is released by the ACM and IEEE Computer Society. We acquired a probabilistic topic model of computer science syllabi, and developed a tool for investigating the actual syllabi in the model. In this paper, we introduce a web-based tool and demonstrate its effectiveness by some examples. By applying our tool to a syllabus, students and teachers can know how strongly the syllabus and topics are related quantitatively, where each topic corresponds to the Knowledge Area of CS2013 such as “Algorithms and Complexity (AL).” In addition, the tool utilizes four meta-topics (HUMAN, THEORY, PROGRAMMING, and SYSTEM), which are extracted by investigating the actual syllabi. The tool also provides a list of syllabi similar to the given syllabus, which are selected from the actual syllabi of the top-ranked universities. These information are beneficial for students to understand the courses and for teachers to improve their syllabi.";

bibo:abstract "In a technology-fueled world, coding is an essential skill for young people. MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), which are free online courses available to a very large number of people, are an effective and increasingly popular option for teaching scientific topics to a worldwide audience. However, despite the large number of MOOCs available on computer science, there is a scarcity of coding-related MOOCs that are designed for children and teenagers. In this paper, we present a programming MOOC that was recently developed by The University of Edinburgh and Universidad ORT Uruguay for teenager high school students with no prior programming experience. The MOOC was collaboratively developed by the two teams, resulting in a shared instructional design but with a bilingual delivery: “Code Yourself” in English and “A Programar” in Spanish. In this paper, we describe the course design for a young audience and we discuss the international co-development of the course materials. Furthermore, we present results from its simultaneous bilingual delivery in spring 2015, where around 85000 students participated. Student surveys show encouraging results: more than 93% found that the course met or exceeded their expectations, and more than 90% stated that they plan to continue programming in the future.";

bibo:abstract "Traditional instructional methods present many obstacles to effective teaching and learning in engineering and computer science courses. These include a reliance on text-based or static mediums to convey equation- and graphics-heavy concepts, a disconnect between theoretical lecture presentations and applied laboratory or homework exercises, and a difficulty in promoting collaborative activities that more accurately reflect an engineering approach to problem solving. Additionally, technical courses can suffer, like any other course, when students are not actively engaged in the learning and when instructors cannot gauge student understanding. This project has explored the utility of Tablet PCs for overcoming these challenges within a sample of courses in engineering and computer science. There were three primary questions: which knowledge domains benefit from the use of Tablet PCs; whether observed benefits are derived from Tablet PC-specific activities; and what problems limit the effectiveness of Tablet PCs in educational settings? The evaluation of assessment data using regression approaches demonstrated that Tablet-PC-specific activities had a consistent, meaningful, and positive impact upon engineering and computer science courses.";

bibo:abstract "The spread of international journals or scientific articles as research supporting material is increasing. This makes the number of available journal documents make it more difficult to find and present journals. Text processing techniques are needed that can categorize large amounts of text documents according to their type, the information available can be accessed properly and easily accessed according to user needs. One of the problems solving in categorizing text documents can be solved by using a text mining method that is classification. This research uses the K-Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm with cosine similarity to categorize the maximum journal document. In general, this research conducted four stages. The initial stage is a process of preprocessing data consisting of case folding, character removal, tokenizing and stopwords removal. The second stage performs TF-IDF weighting on each term and splits a dataset of 450 journals for data sharing training and data testing. The splitting method used is the data holdout method and ten-fold cross-validation. The third stage is modeling the classification using cosine similarity, and K-Nearest Neighbor with the value of k used is 3,6,7,9. There are three abstract categories including Computer and Education, Computer and Security and Computer in Human Behavior. The last stage of analyzing the results of the classification performed.

bibo:abstract "This paper presents a study exploring women's decisions, influencers and early experiences of computing to better understand how women's motivations and prior experience affect their decision to study computer science (CS). The emergence of a gender balance target and government imperatives for Scottish university courses has challenged computer science as a discipline across the 14 universities in which computing is currently taught. The funding body target is that there should be a more equal gender balance, with no course having fewer than 25% of one gender, leading to a proliferation of gender action plans across the university sector. Of course the phenomenon of under-representation extends across developed countries in the west, albeit with a small number of high profile resource-intensive interventions making headway. At present the percentage of women studying computing in the UK is 17%. The lack of female applicants to courses suggests that subject decisions have been made through previous experiences prior to selecting a course and university. Surveying current computer science students (n=185) we explored women's and men's reasons for studying computer science, their influencers and their early experiences of computing. The aim of the study was to examine the motivations and influences that led them to a positive choice of computer science in order to find evidence on which to build a gender action plan. We found that women were introduced to computing at different stages (including home, early schooling and secondary schooling), whereas men were more likely to have been introduced to computers at home. Women also cited slightly more varying reasons for selecting CS, while men were more likely to select it based on personal interest. Both men and women were influenced by friends and family. However, men were slightly more likely than women to make the decision to study computing by themselves, not citing any other influence. The paper reviews the literature on women studying CS and describes the study and findings. It is hoped that this initial work can help universities better understand the nature of the challenge and target resources in the right places to encourage more women to study CS.";

But science tends to be obscure to students, especially when they are overwhelmed by complex engineering design challenges that involve many variables. This article shows how computer graphics can be used to visualize science concepts and operationalize inquiry practices in engineering design to support integrated learning and teaching of science and engineering. Based on these graphical capabilities, generative design driven by evolutionary computation can also be visually illustrated to give students a glimpse into how artificial intelligence is transforming engineering design. The article provides real-world examples in the field of sustainable energy engineering based on Aladdin, an open-source design and analysis Web app. It also presents evidence of learning from pilot tests at culturally diverse high schools.

bibo:abstract "While many initiatives have broadened participation of minoritized youth in K-12 computing education, far fewer efforts have focused on expanding the social, political and cultural contexts of CS identity development. In this study, we propose a “restorying” pedagogy which engaged high school youth in interrogating dominant narratives about computer science through collaborative, electronic textile quilt-making. In our social design experiment approach, we designed and implemented a workshop where 14 racially- and ethnically-diverse youth crafted and coded interactive quilt patches that were digitally “stitched” into a collaborative artifact, with each patch reimagining CS from youths' perspectives (particularly regarding what CS is, who can participate in CS, and how CS is done). By analyzing post-workshop interviews and participant artifacts, we observed that counterstorytelling through electronic quilting can act as accessible and authentic tools to support youth's political identity work, electronic counternarrative expression, and community building in computing education. In the discussion, we address how restorying can contribute towards developing self-authored identities and critical computational literacies among youth and educators, as well as political solidarity within CS learning environments.";

Young people are often viewed as the driving force behind the innovation in mobile technology, since they comprise the majority of early adopters and most avid users of mobile gadgets and applications, especially mobile games. Many contemporary college students grew up surrounded by computer games and electronic gadgets and, therefore, may better relate to mobile technology than to the desktops dominating current academic environment. This paper makes the case for using mobile game development as a motivational tool and a learning context in computing curriculum, which is supported by the results of a large student survey.

bibo:abstract "This research full paper describes our experience in teaching parallel programming for students without previous knowledge of basic concepts of computing, comparing their levels of learning. The use of parallel software grew considerably in recent years due to the increasing availability of multi and many-core devices. The evolution of hardware and software resources collaborated for a remarkable computational processing power offered by parallel programs. However, parallel programming is taught usually in more advanced years of the undergraduate computer courses, due to its supposed prerequisites as sequential programming, operating systems, computer architectures and others. Postponing parallel programming teaching hinder students to apply parallelism other subjects, reducing the probability of these future professionals think on parallel solutions naturally. We executed 05 experiments teaching parallel programming subjects for 252 students. We analyzed whether students without prerequisites could learn parallel programming in the same level verified with students with prior computing knowledge. We used three different teaching methodologies: traditional, Problem Based Learning (PBL), and Team-Based Learning (TBL). The teaching and learning evaluation took into account such metrics: parallelism thinking of students, use of programming-model, correct output of the program, source-code readability and satisfaction of the students. The paper shows that it is possible to teach parallel programming to students without previous knowledge of computing, obtaining high scores and interest in such learning. Our results contribute positively to disseminate parallel programming, which is vital to extract performance from nowadays computers.";

bibo:abstract "A first generation of mobile robots able to cope with the high uncertainty of natural environments is starting to emerge. As a consequence, there is an increasing need for theoretical and practical courses that can formally teach the state of the art of the technology. This paper describes our experience teaching a mobile robotics course as part of our computer science curriculum for undergraduate students. The course has a strong experimental part, where the goal is to provide the students with a set of hand-on experiences using real mobile robots. In particular, we show how using a simple differential drive mobile platform and a low cost visual sensor, it is possible to teach the topics that are currently most relevant to the area of mobile robot programming for autonomous navigation. The course starts by illustrating low level control routines, such as locomotion, and simple behaviors, such as obstacle avoidance and target tracking in non-structured environments. Then, as the course moves to higher level tasks such as localization and mapping, the real world becomes too complex and a more structured world is needed. A structured world, called MazeWorld is then presented where we are able to illustrate high level topics using limited perception capabilities. In addition to the main parts of the class, we also describe the perception algorithms that we developed to achieve autonomous navigation in non-structured environments and in MazeWorld. Our experience indicates that the course is highly motivating for the students. They are able to reinforce several topics from the computer science curriculum and they learn the basis for advanced coursework, research, and the development of applications in robotics and related fields, such as, artificial intelligence and computer perception";

bibo:abstract "In current practice, many issues in computer science are formulated and treated as formal logic theories, even though this style of axiomatization is inappropriate for the topic at hand. Comparison with the scientific approach in more mature disciplines, such as mathematics, physics and applied science, reveals the causes and the unwanted effects of this phenomenon and shows, more generally, that the methodological basis for computer science is still far from being fully developed. The impact on a few important research areas is briefly discussed. It is argued that this state of affairs can be improved by recognizing that the traditional characterization of the discipline of computer science, which may have been appropriate during the initial years, is now due for a major revision, and by broadening the 'pure' computer science curricula through the inclusion of judiciously chosen additional topics in mathematics, physics, and systems theory.<>";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This article presents an experience report on the application of flipped classroom (FC) to the laboratory sessions (henceforth lab sessions) of an undergraduate computer science course. Background: Hands-on work in computer science lab sessions is typically preceded by technical instructions on how to install, configure, and use the software and hardware tools needed during the lab. In the course under study, this initial explanation took between 14% and 50% of the lab time, reducing drastically the time available for actual practice. It was also observed that students missing any of the labs had trouble catching up. Intended Outcomes: The application of FC is expected to increase the time for hands-on activities, and improve students' performance and motivation. This improvement is expected to be more noticeable in those students who are unable to attend all lab sessions. Application Design: The study compares the application of FC and a traditional methodology. It encompasses two academic courses and involves 434 students and six lecturers. Findings: The FC is suitable for lab sessions in computer science. Among other results, flipping the labs resulted in 24 more minutes of practical and collaborative work on average at each lab session. It was observed a significant improvement in the motivation of students, with 9 out of every 10 students preferring it over traditional methodologies. Also, the FC made it much easier for students to catch up after missing a lab, making the final grades less dependent on lab attendance.";

However, even the apparently simple task of analyzing a single sequence of DNA requires complex collaboration. For several years, we have been developing a computer toolkit for analyzing DNA sequences. The biology of gene regulation in mammals has driven the design of the sequence comparison toolkit to emphasize space-efficient algorithms with a high degree of sensitivity and has profoundly affected choice of tools and the development of algorithms. We sketch the biology of this class of problem and show how it specifically drives the software development. The main components of this toolkit are outlined.<>";

bibo:abstract "Many educators have noted the benefits of providing undergraduate students a research experience including increased retention, greater interest in graduate school, and an enhanced educational experience. Different approaches and guidelines have been proposed to accommodate the constraints of working with undergraduate students such as lack of academic maturity, limited student time, and a less developed knowledge base. In our Computer Science program, we have attempted to integrate various aspects of a general approach to research in courses throughout the major. Students get more in-depth exposure and practice in conducting elements of research as they progress through the major. The experience is culminated in two senior-level activities with major research components. In these activities, students are faced with ill-defined problems requiring extensive background investigation and must develop a unique idea to implement, analyze, and formally report on. This paper will describe the general research approach taught, how students are introduced to various aspects of the approach in their courses, and the senior-level experiences in detail with specific examples. The paper concludes with our experience regarding the effectiveness of this approach in providing a research experience.";

bibo:abstract "Many students with little pre-college exposure to computer science (CS) share widespread incorrect ideas and a negative attitude towards the subject, leading to wrong decisions when choosing their major. In order to support these students, we developed a questionnaire built on Kolb's and Pask's learning style theories. Our aim was to create an instrument that allows to predict student performance in CS based solely on non-subject specific information. Using 62 items from two questionnaires to operationalize the three personality traits as described by Kolb and Pask, we selected a subset of 15 items by comparing the results of students with high and low achievements in CS. Subsequently, we determined the so-called DiCS-Index by adding up the values of all these 15 items, where a high DiCS-Index suggests a good performance in CS. Finally, the instrument was tested at our local CS department. The analysis of the personality traits suggests that CS, as a course of studies, is open to a highly heterogeneous student body with varying preferences and strengths. The only significant difference found is a clearly better performance of students who prefer learning through abstract conceptualization as opposed to gathering concrete experience. Concerning the questionnaire, we found a clear distinction between students with high and low achievements indicated by a highly significant difference in their corresponding DiCS-Indices.";

bibo:abstract "This paper reports our experience in flipping a second- year undergraduate course on software architecture and integration, taught in the second course of a Software Engineering degree. We compare the application of the flipped-classroom methodology with a traditional methodology. Our study encompasses two academic courses, in the years 2017 and 2018, and involves a total number of 434 students and 6 lecturers, placing this among the largest studies on flipped-classroom to date. The paper also reports on the production of the videos used with the flipped-classroom methodology, recorded by the lecturers in informal settings, and provides several lessons learned in this regard. The results of the study, backed by a solid statistical analysis of the data, demonstrate the suitability of the flipped-classroom methodology for laboratory sessions in the subject course. Among other results, our analysis concluded that students had on average 24 more minutes per session to solve in-class exercises with the flipped-classroom methodology; more than 70% of the students considered that the quantity, duration and didactic content of the videos were (very) appropriate; and 9 out of every 10 students would prefer this methodology in the laboratory sessions of future courses rather than a traditional face-to-face approach.";

bibo:abstract " This paper presents the results of an analysis of indicators that can be used to predict whether a student will succeed in a Computer Science Ph.D. program. The analysis was conducted by studying the records of 75 students who have been in the Computer Science Ph.D. program of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. Seventy-seven variables were extracted from each student's record, and the variables were correlated with whether the student did or did not successfully graduate from the program. A multivariate model was developed that predicts success with a high degree of accuracy. Importantly, the model relies on variables that can be determined reasonably early in a student's Ph.D. class work, enabling its use as a selection metric. Hypotheses about the composition of the model are also presented and discussed. ";

bibo:abstract "Autism is characterized by a great diversity of disabilities and intensities observed in the development of individuals since their infancy. The search for treatment has increased, and new forms of interventions have emerged, including those involving technology. There are many and different technological solutions that aim to help these individuals learn and execute daily activities. The literature presents a large number of papers describing technologies for autism; however, given the volume of primary and secondary studies, it is difficult to have an overview of the existing solutions and gaps to deal with in future researches. Based on this problem, a literature systematic mapping on review studies about technologies to people with autism was carried out. A total of 33 literature review studies (which analyzed 1298 primary studies) were examined. We categorized these studies according to their area, the support offered, the skill to be developed, the user's development phase, and the kind of technology used. Furthermore, we have also organized the research questions that were already covered in studies and their future works. This will help researchers to identify topics and challenges to be explored by new research.";

In the long run, the low labor costs said to give Mexico a competitive edge will become less relevant, since Mexican government officials see NAFTA as a tool to create jobs, increase salaries and raise average family income. The real issue is whether Mexico can effectively compete in a larger market and stimulate economic growth. To this end, technological development is one of the most important factors. To compete in the global economy, Mexico must stimulate its latent research community. NAFTA can help accomplish this, but scientists, universities and industry must play their role.<>";

In this paper we investigate the motivation of graduate students to pursue doctoral studies specifically in Computer Science. We interviewed 63 doctoral students, from two different doctoral models (traditional and structured) in Finland and Austria, on their initial reasons and experiences that led them to enroll in doctoral studies. We identified five disjoint main motivational drivers that relate with different aspects of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Together with a measure of the strength of their initial motivation, we develop clear motivation profiles of different doctoral program models. We observed that students in structured programs were mainly driven by extrinsic motivation while participants in traditional European doctoral studies were mainly influenced by intrinsic factors. Our results give a practical overview of student motivation for the enhancement of student selection, support, and supervision processes in doctoral programs.";

bibo:abstract "Studies have shown that novice programmers face unnecessary obstacles when they are enrolled in an introductory course alongside students with previous programming experience. Thus a recommended best practice is to have separate courses or separate sections for novice and experienced students in introductory programming courses. At Michigan Tech we have two starting points for our introductory sequence with one aimed at novice programmers and a second aimed at students with some programming experience. We, therefore, assumed that the curriculum was in alignment with this best practice. A survey of our incoming students indicated that students were not enrolling in the courses consistent with our expectations. By changing the timing and means of offering an assessment to determine student placement in the introductory sequence, we were able to substantially impact the make-up of our introductory courses. The change did have the desired positive impact on students in the course for novice programmers. In this paper, we will also discuss some of the other issues we uncovered with this change.";

bibo:abstract "Student attrition is a long-standing problem in Computer Science (CS), as in many other disciplines, and it has gained momentum in the academic sphere. This study employs bibliometric analysis to shed light on the research stream of student attrition within CS. Bibliometric analysis is a popular technique for evaluating published scientific articles when empirical contributions are producing voluminous research streams. We collected 1310 articles from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, published over a period of 22 years from 2000 to 2022, to analyze the most relevant publication venues in the study of attrition in CS. Further analysis revealed the most cited institutions, countries, key themes, and other conceptual information. Keywords, such as “retention,” “computer science education,” “gender,” “introductory programming,” and “student success” emerged as dominant themes in attrition studies. As researchers work intensively to reduce attrition within CS, these thematic areas may continue to shape the future direction of attrition studies. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of research hotspots, thematic areas, and future directions for attrition studies in CS. This outcome could be valuable for young and emerging scholars who are starting their careers and looking to identify research hotspots in this field of interest.";

bibo:abstract "Computing-driven innovation cannot reach its full potential if only a fraction of the population is involved. Without girls and their non-stereotypical contribution, the innovation potential is severely limited. In computer science (CS) and software engineering (SE), the gender gap persists without any positive trend. Many girls find it challenging to identify with the subject of CS. However, we can capitalize on their interests and create environments for girls through interdisciplinary subcultures to spark and foster enthusiasm for CS. This paper presents and discusses the results of an intervention in which we applied a novel interdisciplinary online course in data science to get girls excited about CS and programming by contributing to the grand goal of solving colony collapse disorder from biology and geoecology. The results show the potential of such programs to get girls excited about programming, but also important implications in terms of the learning environment. The startling results show that girls from single-gender classes (SGCs) are significantly more open to CS-related topics and that the intervention evoked significantly more positive feelings in them than in girls from mixed-gender classes (MGCs). The findings highlight the importance of how CS-related topics are introduced in school and the crucial impact of the learning environment to meet the requirements of truly gender-inclusive education.";

This, possibly philosophical question, has come to the surface at Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, where many Chinese students study computer science together with the local students. We did an exploratory study using email interviews to see if our intuitions could be relied on. We collected data from Chinese students studying in master programs and analysed the data using a phenomenographic perspective. A complex intertwined relationship between the content of their learning (the WHAT), the ways in which they went about studying (the HOW), the aims of their studies (the WHY), and the competencies developed from the intercultural context they studied in (the WHERE) was observed. In this paper we offer some insights from the results of the pilot study and discuss how they have shaped our on-going study in the field.";

bibo:abstract "This research to practice full paper presents the results from using a games design intervention to encourage diversity in the uptake of computer science by young people, explore stereotypes with them and increase their awareness of careers in the sector. The intervention is based on an integrated pedagogical framework appropriate for use with primary age school children (age 7 - 11 years). Despite the increasing use of technology, the percentage of young people taking up a computer science education-career path remains stubbornly low in the UK and across a number of other countries, particularly for females and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Previous research suggests that games can be used to generate interest and engage young people with computer science. Other studies advocate targeting young people at an earlier age (7 years or below) and sustaining engagement throughout their education to widen participation in a particular sector. In this intervention, young people designed and developed individual games through a three stage process: design and story development; game building; testing and evaluation. This research adopts elements from two pedagogical learning theories Direct Instruction and Cognitive Constructivism to create an integrated pedagogical framework to support the game creation process and enable effective learning. This provides an approach that can cater for a range of participants' abilities along the novice-expert spectrum and provide an engaging and age appropriate educational experience.The intervention was completed in two cycles: cycle 1 consisted of a series of workshop sessions with 20 young people aged 9-10 years over a period of 5 weeks; and cycle 2 was a single session with 19 young people aged 7-11 years. A quasi-experimental approach was adopted for evaluating the intervention using the following instruments; pre and post questionnaires, planning sheets, the games created by the participants and a set of already developed engagement factors. Results show an increase from 5% to 25% in participants' aspiration towards a computer science career. 45% of the young people also knew more careers in the game industry post-intervention. Girls chose a variety of diversity in their lead characters while boys chose mainly male human lead characters in the games that they designed. Participants' evaluation of each other's games using the engagement factors showed girls were more interested in receiving feedback than boys. This paper highlights the effectiveness of combining different learning approaches to provide an age appropriate intervention. It also presents evidence on the positive effect of using games in the classroom to explore stereotypes, and learn about, and encourage career choices in computer science.";

bibo:abstract "One of the desirable features of quality teaching is individualized attention to students. In this work we present a teaching innovation of individualized support called Just-in-Time-Teaching (JiTT). We describe a pilot experience conducted in a laboratory group and two control groups of the Computer Science Fundamentals subject of bachelor's degrees in industrial engineering at the Barcelona East School of Engineering [EEBE] of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in the first semester of 2016-2017 academic year. In this subject it has been observed that students tend to do fewer exercises than are required. They usually do them in the vicinity of the exams rather than throughout the course, and this has an impact on their learning and their academic performance. The aim of the experience was therefore to improve academic performance and student satisfaction, and to reduce absenteeism. In the JiTT group, exercises were collected via a virtual campus and assessed before the next laboratory class. Data of the university entrance grade, age and origin of the students were collected. The results are presented and compared with the those obtained in the control groups. Significant improvements were found in the final grades and in student satisfaction with the teaching, and absenteeism was reduced. In conclusion, this is a promising method that promotes individualized teaching at a reasonable cost for the teaching staff.";

bibo:abstract "Global warming poses a significant challenge to environmental sustainability due to the high greenhouse gas emissions originating from human activities. Among the various sectors contributing to these emissions, the education sector, particularly at the university level, plays a crucial role in generating carbon footprints. While several studies have examined carbon footprints within universities, few have focused on understanding the behavior and activities of individuals. Statistics show that students are the primary contributors to carbon emissions in higher education. Despite the availability of various methods for calculating carbon emissions, limited studies have utilized such data to predict future trends. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a predictive analytics model that leveraged students’ learning activities as a significant factor to predict future trends in university carbon emissions. Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) was used as a case study, especially computer science-related majors. The carbon emission calculation utilized a formula that incorporated various emission sources, including electricity, transportation, and paper consumption. In the 2022/2023 academic year, ITB generated 612.8 tons of CO $_{2}\\text{e}$ . The prediction modeling employed the SVR algorithm and utilized historical data, such as carbon emissions from the last 30 days, and external information, such as weather, event-related data, and university data. The model’s performance was evaluated using metrics, yielding values of 129.41 for MAE, 158.03 for RMSE, 0.98 for R2, and 15.83 for MAPE. The results provided insights for universities to assess their carbon footprint and raised awareness among the academic community, supporting decision-making to optimize carbon emissions at the students’ level.";

bibo:abstract "Recommendation systems use computational techniques to select items in a personalized way to users, taking into account criteria such as history and interest. However, several authors point out that the process of recommendation in education requires models beyond the user's taste, in order to catalyze students' learning. In addition, feedback involves the student's experience. In this work we present a recommendation system of learning objects supported by a cognitive pedagogical model. The central idea of the system is to find an object that adequately challenges the student without bothering with similar problems or becoming discouraged when faced with problems beyond his or her ability. We integrate learning models into game models to integrate them into learning models. We used as a case study a virtual learning environment which has a repository with programming problems. The results indicate that, in general, when students choose more appropriate problems (ELOs similar to theirs), they get a greater number of correct answers in their submissions. When the student choose problems that do not seem to be challenging, in general, they make wrong submissions or give up learning on the platform.";

The rationale underlying this course was teaching high school students a second, very different programming paradigm. Using LSC for this purpose has other advantages, such as exposing students to high-level programming, dealing with nondeterminism and concurrency, and referring to human-computer interaction (HCI) issues. This work also contributes to the discussion about guiding principles for curriculum development. It highlights an important principle: the educational objective of a course should include more than mere knowledge enhancement. A course should be examined and justified through its contribution to learning fundamental ideas and forming useful habits of mind.";

This paper introduces Computer Science Academic Rankings System (CSAR) which aims at academic information extracting, mining and ranking. In this paper we mainly present approaches for information extraction and normalization in CSAR. For semi-structured and unstructured web pages such as paper-view pages, we propose a method with natural language processing n-gram model and web grammar. We generate an optimal matching bipartite graph to extract authors and organizations information with maximum likelihood. CSAR also uses KM algorithm and Hungarian algorithm to find authors and emails correspondence. For information normalization, we introduce n-gram model, EM algorithm and trigram model with linear interpolation to construct part-of-speech tagger, with which to extract useful information from web source. Then TF-IDF model and string edit distance are applied to finish normalizing organization names. In experiment, our proposed approaches obtain high accuracy rate and great improvements of academic information extraction.";

bibo:abstract "Ontologies are considered one of the pillars of the Semantic Web. The semantic Web relies heavily on formal ontologies that structure subjacent data and information in machine-readable way for the purpose of that knowledge can be automatically read and processed by machines. In this work, the authors present an ontological approach of the essentials necessary for IEEE and ACM Computer Science Curricula (CS2013). The goal of this work is the improvement of the usability of curriculum through the design and implementation of Computer Science Ontology. The ontological definitions of concepts, data properties, and data objects, can be useful to impose and preserve a logical structure for new types of curricula concepts, which may appear due to autonomous Higher Education Institutions (HEI). Users benefit from getting information in open portable data formats. In this way, the developed ontology is a powerful tool that can change the way that knowledge about curriculum are specified, managed, aligned, analyzed, and shared. The semantic representation of curricula can be used in multiple modes of learning, promote academic mobility, accelerate the recognition of academic credits obtained in different educational institutions, and to integrate and interoperate different curricula of departments of computer science, or enable the convergence and interoperability of other disciplines.";

bibo:abstract "To meet socio-cultural demands imposed by the new millennium and its implications for education, it was necessary for teachers and students to participate actively in the teaching-learning process. In this context, the classes' evaluation by students has been a tool widely used in various universities in different countries. For institutions and teachers, these assessments allow knowing and measuring the results, further analysis of the institutional status, reviewing projects, adjusting goals, diagnosing weaknesses and correcting possible deviations. For the monitoring and improvement of this process, it was necessary to create instruments that aimed to evaluate the performance of the proposed changes. The teaching-learning methodology adopted in the Introduction to Computer Science classes may be a process that makes it difficult to understand the principles of language programming for undergraduate students in Computer Science and related areas, generating high failure and course drop out rates. This paper presents an analysis of the results obtained in the Introduction to Computer Science classes taught in five Engineering courses, of the Faculty of Gama (FGA) at University of Brasília (UnB). It was analyzed the evaluation questionnaire answered by the undergraduate students in 2017, perform validation of the questionnaire, check the level of students satisfaction in relation to the evaluated subject and the association among the level of satisfaction, the percentage of practical activities of the discipline, student performance and the level of absenteeism. 519 responses were studied, 63% of students reported satisfaction with the classes taken, however a significant number of students 37% reported dissatisfaction with assessment practices and the dynamics of the classes.";

This strategy was successfully used in a final-year course of a Computer Science program at Carlos III University of Madrid, Spain. Its use has demonstrated an improvement in the maintainability of the Web projects developed as well as a decrease in the number of failures during the test phase. This is a very important step toward the engineering of Web applications.

The study was conducted at the Research Lab for Educational Technologies (University of Vienna) in order to find connecting factors for improving students' networks by means of curricular design as well as in single courses. Social Networks drawings and accompanying detailed descriptions provided by students were analyzed according to network analysis measures and set into relation with qualitative content analyses. Additionally qualitative interviews on how course instructors can foster social networks among students were conducted. Empirical results show that university courses provide good opportunities to build networks among students. As expected, students are more likely to experience a supporting network if they have more contacts as well as stronger ties to those colleagues. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate that virtual communication via e- mail or chat plays a significant role in maintaining contacts among study colleagues. Finally, there is reflected the influence of students' habits to communicate via new media upon their social networks as well as upon the didactical concept of university courses.";

Within recent years, it has become apparent that programming is a much harder task than it was once thought to be, especially for large production-oriented systems involving a number of people. This concern has led to the need for educating software engineering specialists to work on the construction of such systems.";

bibo:abstract "The academic community has seen a tremendous growth in number of authors and publications in recent times. Most previous studies of the academic community, whether on individual activity, productivity and influence, or collaboration patterns and their implications, have been based on a flat and static view of the system. However, the academic community resembles a dynamic growing population, with entry and exit of authors. In this paper, we study this systemic inflation by proposing a population model for academia. We use a generalized branching process as an overarching framework, which enables us to describe the research community from an evolutionary and structural perspective. Further, the observed patterns allow us to shed light on researchers' life-cycle encompassing their arrival, academic life expectancy, activity, productivity and offspring distribution in the community. In our study, we used data from DBLP for a case study in the computer science community, although our methodology can be adopted in a systematic manner to any other research domain with sufficient publication records. We believe that the results can help academics and policy makers alike to better understand and evaluate the development and evolution of their respective academic communities.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This innovative practice full paper presents a novel approach based on active learning pedagogical strategies and entrepreneurship programmes to teach entrepreneurship to computer science and engineering students. The proposed approach has been tailored for undergraduate classes in order to provide the students with the initial stages of developing a technological startup. Background: Within the computer science and engineering literature, there are some interesting works that deal with entrepreneurial education in different levels and concepts. However, there has not been a paper describing a hands-on approach that makes them experience the important initial stages of a startup. Intended Outcomes: By the end of the course the students will be able to: (1) Validate whether or not their idea can become a business; (2) Build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for their solution; (3) Elaborate a Business Model Canvas (BMC); (4) Present their solution and BMC to potential investors. Application Design: There are some very interesting approaches to teach entrepreneurship in programmes outside of the university, such as the startup weekend, which has created several successful startups. Findings: Before taking this module the majority of the students did not have any contact with any type of entrepreneurship education programme or startup related event such as hackathons. While taking the module, several students attended related events. Some of them got involved with other university entrepreneurship initiates.";

bibo:abstract "The current practice for fusion scientists running first principle simulations on high performance computing plat-forms is to either run their simulations and output their data for post-hoc analysis, or to place in situ analytics into their code. In this paper we examine a complex workflow using XGC fusions simulation run on the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility's supercomputer Summit, which also involve three anal-yses as part of the results necessary for scientific discovery. We discuss the challenges faced when implementing these algorithms and present an original hybrid staging technique to help enable the physicists to make discoveries during the execution of the simulation. By creating this infrastructure, we can examine complicated physics results, which may not have been possible without the infrastructure. For example, our work enables the online visualization of turbulent homoclinic tangle around the magnetic X-point, breaking the last confinement surface. This visualization could help fusion scientists to better understand and improve the turbulence spread of plasma exhaust heat, which is crucial toward realizing plasmas beyond the currently accessible physics regimes of present-day tokamak reactors. The physics of turbulent homoclinic tangle will be reported in a future physics publication, by utilizing the original online analysis/visualization framework presented in this paper.";

bibo:abstract "Because of the present deep impact of information technology on society, school subjects that deal with topics of computer science or digital literacy gain importance nowadays. Some countries start to teach related topics in primary education and even in kindergarten. The underlying curricula, educational standards and/or competency models have already been developed and established and differ in a lot of points. Because of these differences, a comparison is a complex task. In this paper a graph-based approach is applied to introduce a framework for comprehensibly evaluating the different curricula, standards and competency models and to demonstrate its use by analyzing and comparing six existing curricula, standards and competency models. Our approach maps the content of curricula and standards to a directed graph by connecting their knowledge items with each other via dependency relations. This method enables a formalized comparison using graph theoretical metrics like the highest degrees, numbers of sources and sinks, or the connectivity. The representation is mapped to a graph database, allowing for further analysis of the content and preparing the ground for teachers and curriculum-developers to individually form a computer science curriculum in primary schools.";

In order to address this challenge, a workshop was developed to expose children aged 12-14 years to core concepts in programming by letting them manipulate widespread tangible embedded systems. With the help of qualitative surveys, the influence of this workshop on middle school students' perceptions of computer science were examined. The results indicate that children, especially girls, perceived the computer as a central element of computer science and not primarily as a tool. However, the proposed two-hours long workshop seems to influence the children's perceptions: they spoke about programming, electronic/electricity and creativity.";

bibo:abstract "In-service teaching assistant (TA) training often receives relatively limited attention from university decision makers when compared to the plethora of courses designed for junior faculty (i.e., peer-to-peer mentoring or 'buddy' system) in tertiary institutions around the world. In Hong Kong, as in many other parts of the world, TAs serve in different capacities to provide front-line teaching and learning support in the university, despite their insufficient experience in using active learning strategies or grading students' assignments. Major challenges faced by new TAs, especially non-local graduates (as many of City University of Hong Kong's (CityU) graduate research students are originally from the Chinese Mainland), include the relative absence of teaching experience, the difficulty to switch from a teacher-centered approach to a student-centered approach, the adoption of English as the medium of instruction (EMI), and role transformation. This paper presents an innovative approach in providing a compulsory In-service Teaching Assistant Training (InsTAT) course for all graduate research students at CityU before undertaking any teaching-related duties: it includes an unconventional but effective multi-directional engagement team teaching approach with the extensive support of e-learning technologies throughout the course. Comments and feedback data show that students found the course very engaging, useful, and innovative.";

bibo:abstract "This Innovative Practice Full Paper discusses a coding/programming academy that used games and robotic programming as engaging hands-on approaches to teach 6th grade (the first grade in secondary education in USA) females coding/programming concepts to increase their knowledge and interest in computer science. Careers in computer science continue to grow, but fewer women than men are even considering these careers. Increasing participation of women in coding/programming is necessary to meet the growing demand for computing professionals to develop a diverse workforce. Today, many organizations are implementing programming coding/programming academies/camps that attempt to engage students in computer science, at an early age, by exposing them to fun and interesting computer science skills in coding/programming. We have developed a coding/programming academy that uses educational robotics and hands-on game applications to demonstrate computing concepts to young females. To address pressing equity issues of the lack of females in computer science careers, the goal of this summer coding/programming academy was to educate and empower young females, at an early age, to discover computer science careers, which has been one of the first attempts to establish a coding/programming academy for females in our region. Our coding/programming academy differs from others in several ways. First, it was for 6th-grade females only, to take advantage of preferences of noncompetitive and social learning opportunities, in order to improve female participation. Second, we hired female instructors and invited female professionals from local industries to assist the academy by serving as mentors. Third, it introduced both robotic and game coding/programming to the females. Fourth, it adopted social learning, e.g., pair programming. A formal assessment of the 2018 academy found that the academy's female participants experienced a significant increase in knowledge and interest in computer science. This paper describes the organization, coordination, content, and assessment of the coding/programming academy. It describes how the academy was organized and taught, which includes a brief description of the instructional materials, the concepts taught in each hands-on session, how the academy was assessed and the assessment results, and the first-year experience of conducting the coding/programming academy, and lessons learned. The intent of this paper is to provide all the information needed for others to host similar academies and further prompt the effort to increase female participation in computer science careers.";

bibo:abstract "This paper presents preliminary findings from the pilot run of a survey instrument exploring professional identity formation in computer science. Students in computer science (CS) majors negotiate their concept of professional identity (PI) through coursework and engagement in legitimate practices of the computing profession, such as assignments, projects, and internships. Successful PI formation may occur without conscious effort for many CS students, while others struggle to form an authentic sense of identifying with the profession. Poor identity formation may contribute to withdrawal from the major or from the field. Assessing the impact of curricular and extracurricular offerings on students' PI formation may be difficult for educators. This paper presents development of a survey instrument for measuring PI and findings from its administration with 176 undergraduate CS majors. The survey development was informed by semi-structured interviews with 19 students. For the survey, participants identify job titles they would consider applying to in the future. They then respond to how well one of their possible future job titles describes them in their current role in academia, from their own perspective and from the perspectives of peers and a supervisor. Students who were more advanced in their major, had completed an internship, or participated in a capstone course, responded that the future job title described them more strongly than students earlier in their studies. The pilot data indicates no statistically significant difference in PI strength across gender, but PI was measurably different between Bachelors of Science and Bachelors of Arts CS students at our institution.";

bibo:abstract "Graduating computer science students with skills sufficient for industrial needs is a priority in higher education teaching. Project-based approaches are promising to develop practical and social skills, needed to address real-world problems in teams. However, rapid technological transition makes an initial training of contemporary methods challenging. This affects the currently much-discussed machine learning domain as well. The study at hand describes a re-framed teaching approach for a machine learning course, offered to various computer science master programs. Project-based learning is introduced with differentiated projects provided by industrial partners that address the diverse study programs. Course attendees are supported with manuals, tools, and tutoring, passing through the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). Observations made during two iterations are reported, accompanied by a first empiric evaluation of student experiences.";

bibo:abstract "While LEGO® MINDSTORMS® robots and Arduino boards are widely used today in high school education to stimulate pupils' interest for technology-related subjects or to introduce beginner computer science students to programming, it is interesting how these tools may be successfully used also in programming education of technology-agnostic non-computer science majors. A possible lack of motivation as well as of practical IT skills to handle the development environments for these tools here form a specific challenge. Therefore, in this paper a learning environment and toolchain especially tailored for this target group is proposed and empirically evaluated in a classroom setting. Results indicate that with a proper setup and development environment these \"geek toys\" may be successfully used also for more technology-agnostic audiences.";

bibo:abstract "Teaching large classes with about 1500 freshmen of mechanical engineering in modeling automata, model driven approaches and C-programming is a challenge for every university lecturer. Since effective learning requires feedback and interaction, e.g. approval of program correctness, hints for improvement etc., a web-based system called PIT (Prüfungssystem Informationstechnik, engl. examination tool of information technology) has been developed and introduced in 2010. Students homework and tests during the semester are done interactively with PIT, giving tutors the time to assist students and not only to review their homework and tests. Hence, there are two substantial benefits: A more effective education and support for the students and a reduction of the costs for the institute. Over the past few years, PIT has been extended regularly. In 2012 the addition of a new plant programming exam was done with great effort. In the summer semester of 2013 the new exam was obligatory for the students for the first time. Altogether, every student had to do three e-learning exams, one plant programming exam and finally one written exam. A detailed evaluation of the exams showed a great improvement of performance by female compared to male students and the benefits of the new plant programming exam which are presented in this paper.";

bibo:abstract "Students' goal orientations impact their self-regulation, engagement, and achievement in post-secondary STEM courses. But, how students' goal orientations change across a semester and the impacts of these changes have not been extensively studied. Study purposes were to investigate goal orientation change across the semester, associations of goal change with achievement and self-regulation, and associations of classroom climate with goal change. Participants were 175 students from college introductory computer science courses. MANOVA identified significant during semester decreases for all goal orientations except task-avoid (Wilks' λ = .724, F (6, 169.00) = 10.71, p <.001, partial Eta2 = .276). No differences in goal orientation change were found for gender, year in college, or course. Goal orientation change significantly predicted students' course grades, retention of CS content, and strategic self-regulation. Classroom climate significantly predicted goal orientation change. Results indicate that students began the semester with positive goal orientations, but shifted in negative directions over the semester. In college STEM classes, the primary motivational issue may not be motivating students' to initially set learning-and task-approach goals, but rather motivating them to maintain their initial positive goals. Perceptions of course affect and teacher directedness predicted students' goal shifts, suggesting potential avenues for intervention by educators.";

bibo:abstract "This research paper introduces a unique system called ZORQ that is a combination of a game development framework and a gamification framework (GDGF). The ZORQ GDGF acts as a catalyst to help motivate students by increasing student engagement and success within undergraduate Computer Science (CS) education, regardless of student experience and background. The dynamic gamification elements utilized within the GDGF make it an attractive learning method for students. After collaborative game space customization, ZORQ gameplay sees each student tasked with designing a ship movement philosophy and then implementing their own code to autonomously control the ship in an interstellar game space filled with supplies, obstacles, and enemy ships. The particulars of engagements between ships can vary greatly by semester, along with the resources/objects present in the game, depending on the collaborative customization and the independent ship strategies implemented.A preliminary ZORQ trial was conducted over five years in an undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course. The ZORQ trial is designed to fulfill the following objectives: 1) implement DSA concepts discussed within the course, 2) identify appropriate problem-solving approaches, 3) apply one or more solutions, 4) build depth with a coding language, 5) bridge the gap between limited concept assignments and large, multi-developer software systems by allowing students to build code within a larger architecture, 6) introduce students to version control, 7) illustrate the use of prior mathematics coursework in practical applications, and 8) introduce unit testing in software systems. In exit surveys, students expressed overwhelming satisfaction with this approach. More than 84% of the students surveyed found the system useful in their educational experience and saw benefit to inspecting a completed software project. 82% of the students found that ZORQ increased software development comprehension. 80% enjoyed using their own personal creativity in designing a ship controller, 76% found ZORQ helped them learn how to implement and use DSAs. 71% found the system engaging and found the system interaction to be clear and understandable. Observations of student performance in later courses suggest better student maturity and comprehension in preparation for proposing and implementing their own independent projects.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This study identifies which entry-level computer science (CS) resume items are most important and compares the ratings of student and recruiter participants to investigate the accuracy of student beliefs. To the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the extent to which CS students understand the resume screening process. The results of this have consequences for students in their own resume development. Background: Although prior research studies the importance of different resume items generally, little is known about resumes for CS majors, which may contain distinctive sections. Less still is known about whether students understand the resume screening process. Research Questions: Which items on entry-level CS resumes most directly influence screening decisions? What gaps exist between CS students’ and recruiters’ perceptions of resume items? Does the disparity in expertise between students and recruiters contribute to differences in resume screening? Methodology: 197 recruiters and 73 CS undergraduates screened randomized CS resumes. Data were analyzed using ordinary least-squares regression with interactions. Findings: Students were more likely than recruiters to move resumes to the next level and spent about 7 s less than recruiters when screening resumes. Though students correctly assessed the value of most resume items, they significantly overestimated the value of prior work experience such as internships.";

The course is novel in that it takes a holistic approach to motivate and prepare students for their further studies. Core subjects and useful tools are mixed together into an intense 10-week course with 12 separate course modules on different topics, often running in parallel. The course has a total of 21 individual examinations to take, tasks to carry out, and deadlines to meet. The examinations and tasks are chosen among those common in our School of Engineering. Evaluations show that, although demanding for the students, the course works well and fulfills its goals.";

To address issues related to self-efficacy and teacher preparation, we started a formal program (IDoCode) that not only provides teacher training through the academic year, but also provides teachers the opportunity to obtain a Masters in STEM Education degree or a Graduate Certificate in Computer Science Teacher Endorsement.Through our program, we have shown that teachers feel more confident in their ability to teach computer science courses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and the Java-based AP CS A, as well as leading the students in a capstone project. In this paper, we present a sustainable approach to make a cultural change in the landscape of Computer Science education in the state of Idaho. We discuss various factors including working with the State Board of Education, local software companies, the university, and other invested partners to help CS courses in high school count towards graduation. We have also been active with respect to community engagement by organizing an annual meeting with counselors and principals to encourage women and minorities to take computer science courses and conducting summer professional development workshops for new teachers.";

bibo:abstract "There is a striking difference in female participation in computer science (CS) courses between developing countries and industrially developed ones. In industrially developed countries, there has been a decline in female participation in CS courses. Less well known is the fact that there is actually a difference in female participation in CS courses and in the rate of decline within Europe. It cannot therefore be said that the rate of decline is directly connected to the level of economic development. In fact, the state of technological development within many Third World countries is very high. Moreover, the globalization of computing implies the requirement of equal competence in CS between nations. Within the European Latin countries and in Greece and Turkey (collectively labelled L) as well as in the Slavonic countries and Bulgaria and Rumania (labelled S), the situation is very different from that found in the Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian and German-speaking (ASG) countries. After giving some figures, I present six different and context-dependent explanations for these facts. These explanations require an examination of the structural and cultural constructions of the gender-technology relation. While structural causes can explain the differences between the S countries and ASG countries, as well as between the Third World and ASG countries, the difference between L countries and ASG countries seems to be most interesting because it cannot have its grounds in differences of political systems nor in the state of economic development.";

Educational activities designed to acquire knowledge from experience lead students (pupils) to make own abstract or mental models only after finishing the activity. According to our experience, we should conclude that learners really learn from their attempts and mistakes even at computer science classes. Their disengagement should be reduced by the involvement of something personally significant. Teachers should ensure that activities are designed and carried out in ways that offer each learner the chance to engage in the manner that suits them to the best. The paper describes selected computer science activities that should be used to engage the pupils or students in the learning process. We conclude that relatively simple teaching aid could help to explain even abstract computer science underlying concepts through the experience sometimes more effectively than through instructional model.";

bibo:abstract "Interactive learning content is a key to the success of online learning materials. Hence, many systems for creating and delivering interactive content has been developed in academia. In practice, however, teachers have to choose the suitable system from the multitude of available choices, thus limiting themselves to the features of that system. Furthermore, educational researchers have data collected in different formats by different systems. In this paper, we describe how we worked around these issues when implementing a new introductory computer science course using the ViLLE learning environment. The new course consists of six main topics, each of which is covered on a lecture and an online tutorial. The tutorials contain textual material together with numerous automatically assessed exercises with visual and immediate feedback. As we developed the course material, we integrated two educational systems - JSAV for algorithm simulation exercises and js-parsons for program construction tasks - into the ViLLE environment in order to use them on the course. This was enabled by the use of the framework for creating exercises into the ViLLE learning environment. The framework aims at easing the inclusion of interactive exercise into the environment by exercise system developers. In the paper, we briefly describe the course, the ViLLE exercise framework and out technical solution, as well as student results from the course and feedback on the exercise types.";

This novel approach is based on empowering students to create their own music-related game using real music instruments. In order to allow the students to program their games we have used the Greenfoot Introductory Learning Environment to teach object-oriented programming skills with the java programming language. We have also taught the students music theory and practice. All these skills were required to allow the students to successfully develop their musical games that interact with the music instruments.";

ECS is designed to foster deep engagement through equitable inquiry around computer science concepts. If the course provides a meaningful and relevant experience, it will increase students' expectancies of success as well as increase their perceived value for the field of computer science. Using survey research, we sought to measure whether the relevance of students' course experiences influenced their expectancies and value and whether those attitudes predicted whether students pursued further computer science coursework. The results indicate that students whose course experience increased expectancies for success were more likely to take another course.";

Even though design description tools and circuit compilers have kept up with the increasing levels of integration found in current implementation media such as FPGAs and microcontrollers, it has become increasingly difficult for students to test and debug the complex hardware projects enabled by these modern tools and devices. In this paper we describe an inexpensive digital circuit testing environment that greatly simplifies the test and debug experience. This environment, consisting of the tester hardware and its corresponding software, enables students to experience the challenges of testing and debugging without the expense of costly commercial hardware testers or the drudgery of setting up ad hoc hardware test jigs. The MacTester has been in use in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington for three years in both undergraduate and graduate hardware design courses as sell as independent study and research projects.";

bibo:abstract "An academic scholarship program for engineering and computer science transfer students, primarily from the community college, began in 2003. The CIRC/METS project - Collaborative Interdisciplinary Research Community/Maricopa Engineering Transition Scholars - is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to retain transfer students in engineering and computer science degree programs and further, to have them choose to attend graduate school right after completion of the Bachelor's degree or within a few years of working in industry. The program targets women and underrepresented minority students. This program works in cooperation with the Maricopa Engineering Transition Scholars (METS) program, also funded by NSF, which informs and encourages community college students to choose engineering or computer science as a career. The CIRC/METS program, with six meetings per semester, helps the transfer student not only with a scholarship, but also with adjusting socially, academically, and making use of valuable resources. This paper will report on the results of four years of transfer students, since some transfer students were similarly supported for one year before the CIRC/METS funding began. To date nearly 50 students have participated in this successful program";

This early period overlapped with an renovation movement, and the most notable efforts to appropriate the new technology were initiated at the universities. Led by mathematician Manuel Sadosky, the most relevant contribution came from the Calculus Institute (Instituto de Cálculo, IC) at the University of Buenos Aires. From 1961 to 1966, equipped with a Ferranti Mercury computer, the IC went through a period of rapid growth, and it was fundamental to creating the first computer science degree program in Latin America. After the country's coup d'état in 1966, approximately 90 percent of IC's personnel resigned. Afterward, no institution could match its scientific and professional expertise nor equal its authority and leadership in the field, despite the modernizing rhetoric of the new authorities.";

bibo:abstract "The development of information technologies in Ukraine in the second half of the twentieth century is considered. The so-called electronic period was represented by the rapid development of computer science centers in Lviv, Kyiv and Kharkiv. First of all, computer technology was used in the Space. On-board computers were created at enterprises and special design bureaus, and software for studying the Moon was developed. At the same time, equipment for submarines was developed. Special CS for intercontinental ballistic missiles and launch vehicles were developed too. The article presents which departments were created in universities and institutes and who headed them. It is noted that despite the rapid development of information technology in Ukraine, money for the installation of equipment, as well as proper software support was not allocated by the country's leadership. And this is the reason that our country, despite the rapid start in the development of information technology in the second half of the twentieth century, it lagged sharply behind other European countries at the end of the last century.";

This paper presents the results of our first two years of studying the programs at Miami University and North Carolina State University to determine the kinds of communication utilized in our courses and how communication is taught and assessed. When looking at student attitudes towards communication our analyses suggest that students do not consider technical (professional) activities such as code reading, writing, and inspections as communication activities, and the same applies to more complex genres such as software testing or design. They also appear to have difficulty relating writing and reading that may take place in the context of the courses to what they might be doing as software engineers and computer scientists once they start working. On the other hand, initial results indicate that our students' communications skills increase steadily throughout their stay in the university. We have also identified potential strategies for improved instruction in communication.";

dbo:rank "1403";
dblp:bibtexType "Journals";
bibo:abstract "In information technology, an ontology is a knowledge structure consisting of terminologies (topics), their definitions, and relational information within one or multiple domains. This semantically represented information can be used for downstream tasks, such as document classification and recommendation systems. However, as big data prevails, manually extending existing ontologies with up-to-date information becomes challenging due to the tedious and time-consuming process and the expensive cost of expert manual labor. To alleviate this problem, this paper aims to achieve a fully automatic ontology extension. We propose a novel “Direct” approach for extending an existing Computer Science Ontology (CSO). This approach consists of two steps: initially extending the CSO with new topics and using this extended graph to obtain the new topic’s node embeddings as inputs for training classifiers. However, this initial extension still contains numerous noisy links; therefore, the classifier simultaneously acts as a noisy-link filter and a link predictor. We experiment with various traditional machine learning and recent deep learning models and then compare them under our Direct approach framework. We propose two evaluation procedures to decide the best-performing model: a novel Wikipedia-based  $F1_{w}$  score and a total number of resulting links. Further meta-evaluation employing four experts confirmed the reliability of our proposed approach and evaluation procedures. We found that the Direct approach’s Gaussian Naive Bayes model produces the most valid and reliable links; therefore, we use it to further extend the CSO with hundreds of new CS topics and links.";

Increasing numbers of Internet-ready devices have propelled e-Learning forward such that these deficiencies in cultural-awareness can no longer remain unattended. Despite being investigated from an instructional design standpoint, the enculturation of digital learning environments has largely been theorized, necessitating manual enculturation by experts, instructors and even students. Consequently, enculturated learning environments are limited in practice. In this paper, a preliminary design for building a web-based Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is described together with the features and intended functionality of the various components. This work contributes a practical approach that was implemented and evaluated using two concrete systems within the domain of Computer Science education. An analysis of the findings and empirical evidence reported in the study supports the viability of the approach taken and reveals that intelligent tutoring systems benefit from enculturation.";

The paper aims to empirically examine this RWF in terms of reflection indicators and levels that can be manually assessed by raters. The results of this manual content analysis showed empirically that the coding scheme of the RWF is valid and reliable. The results were that the inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the overall coding scheme of the RWF increased from 0.5 to 0.8 in pilot tests and ranged between 0.40 and 0.75 in terms reflection indicators and levels; substantially, this means ranged from moderate to substantial agreement.

Through a focus on the educators' perceptions, reflections, and interpretations, we found that the activities encouraged educators to honor expertise not typically valued in computer science, to broker rich, authentic interactions with students in and outside of class, strengthen school-home connections, and to welcome and uplift students who had not felt successful in computing environments before. This study emphasizes how maker projects like e-textiles can support the development of culturally responsive educators to better guide meaningful and enduring learning experiences for diverse students in computer science.";

In games for health, one more type of professional must be included which is the one with health knowledge. The Jecripe Project has the aim of developing serious games for people with special needs. The professionals from health science are speech therapists and more professionals have the intention to be part of the mentioned project. However, this work presents how a serious game project motivated studies in different Computer Science research areas. We describe the three main studies in the Jecripe Project, each of one in a different area: Computer Vision, Data Mining and Human-Computer Interaction. The intention of the continuation in the project is to perform more studies including the integration of natural user interfaces in games for people with special needs.";

In the latter, students are assigned to projects proposed by actual customers and work together in teams to deliver quality results under time and resource constraints. We are interested in the learning results, such as skills acquired, e.g. by analysing the interaction between students and customers to determine how and to what degree the students transform through project based collaborative learning. As for the former course, we intend to determine the added value of collaborative teaching, aiming at equipping the participants with both technical and non-technical skills required for their prospective jobs. The primary goal is, therefore, to allow students to manage a relatively large number of tools with little prior knowledge and having to work out how to obtain detailed information about given features when required. In other words, students have to understand the key ideas of web application development in order to be able not only to apply technical knowledge, but also to successfully interact with all the stakeholders involved.";

bibo:abstract "Numerous (mostly commercial) Web-based systems for the assessment of programming assignments have emerged in the past few years to support the teaching and learning of programming fundamentals. WeBWorK, an initiative led by the University of Rochester to support Mathematics education, is unusual in that it is an open-source and extensible system. Since 2005, collaborators at Pace University and Cornell College have been working to adapt WeBWorK to extend its reach to Computer Science. This paper reports on a global experiment undertaken with Computer Science students and faculty from three continents based on the use of WeBWorK. Students in the US, Cambodia, India, Senegal and Thailand were presented with a set of programming exercises in a controlled environment. The intention was to explore the impact of diverse cultures, distinct first languages and differences in prior everyday exposure to the Internet and use of pedagogical tools on the usability and perceived value of such tools in Computer Science education. The study poses an important question with regard to the global uptake of everyday and typically US-centric educational technology. It provides findings likely to be of value to academic institutions interested in its adoption and companies interested in its commercialization.";

bibo:abstract "Virtual education raises to students and teachers important challenges, normally different to those faced in conventional education. In the context of virtual education, a question that remains to be solved is associated with the level of motivation possessed by the students during the course. Usually, at the School of Engineering in the University of Medellín, this issue is tackled through activities such as chats and forums. Mostly, these activities are not enough to motivate the student in the activities related with the learning process. This work proposes two motivation strategies based on gamification and constructivism. These strategies are validated in a course called programming fundamentals, taught to all bachelor degrees given in the School of Engineering. Results obtained through the experiments suggest that proposed strategies improve the student's performance and satisfaction in the course. Therefore, when teaching at the virtual scenario, using Information and Communication Technologies in the educational environment is not only the way to contact the student, it is the mean to develop pedagogical-didactic approaches that finally enrich the educational process and consequently motivate the student to perform well.";

The goals for the multi-disciplinary design project (MDP) are to provide our 3rd year undergraduates with the opportunities to apply the theoretical knowledge acquired from their early years to solving a practical problem, foster a continuous improvement mindset, and experience the benefits and challenges of working collaboratively in a large team. This requires the formulation of a suitably complex problem that can integrate the skill sets from both the CE and CS programmes. It also requires suitable assessment strategies that can evaluate the students at the individual level, at the group level and at the inter-group level. This paper shares our pedagogical considerations in designing the project module, our experience gleaned from conducting the module over the last five years and some results of a recent online survey conducted to gather students' feedback on their experience of MDP.";

bibo:abstract "Affective (emotional) responses contribute to student engagement and, ultimately, to the decision to persist or withdraw from Computer Science as a discipline of study. We investigate affective response as a factor contributing to engagement and professional identity formation during the university-to-work transition, as supported during a senior capstone project experience. By conducting qualitative interviews and focusing on student discussion of their emotional responses during the capstone project, we note three specific ways in which affective responses contribute to the student experience. First, students are receptive to the affective responses of project sponsors during project pitching and later evaluation. Second, student affective responses are present throughout the capstone project experience, and vary widely over the life of the project. Third, student affective responses provide an indication of their engagement and investment in the projects, and are linked to real-world impact of project outcomes. This paper presents a theoretical background for focusing on affective responses in the educational space, as contributing to engagement and professional identity formation. We conclude with suggestions for how these findings might inform educational development across the CS discipline.";

The paper focuses on the programming and Maths aspects, being fundamental to IoT development, in addition to computational thinking and coding concepts for the HE students. The research objective is to build a framework for developing IoT skills within higher education to establish the computing competencies needed for this rapidly expanding technology. The investigation included the most widely used programming language for IoT, Python, and the Maths skills at the HE level, which are essential for developing successful infrastructure, functionality, security algorithms and encryption tools for IoT. Quantitative research methodology is applied on empirical data obtained on non-Computer Science students (Non-CS) in a HE institution in UAE. There is a correlation between in university (InUni) Maths skills and Python programming course's performance. Compared to Engineering students, Business students may found it more challenging to learn Python programming language, which also applies to their Maths skills. This suggests better IoT competencies developed by Engineering students. The paper concluded that N on-CS students are able to obtain sufficient knowledge of, and skills in, using Python within one semester. The future study should consider other factors, such as general knowledge, business awareness, technology applications and legal issues.";

The application of quantum computing to machine learning (i.e., quantum machine learning) is similarly growing rapidly.

Historically, the barrier to entry of quantum computing has been nearly insurmountable for computer science students, or any other students who lack a strong physics background. However, quantum computing and quantum machine learning are becoming increasingly accessible, regardless of background. The goal of this paper is to present and demonstrate that the field is accessible to computer science students and to provide a sample curriculum.

bibo:abstract "Although Computer Science has grown to become one of the most highly demanded professional careers, every year, only a small percentage of students choose a degree directly related to Computer Science. Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of information that society has about Computer Science itself, and particularly about the work computer scientists do. No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking). In this article, we present Piens@ Computacion@ULLmente, a project that provides a methodology to promote Computer Science through Computational Thinking activities among primary and secondary education students. The results obtained from an exhaustive statistical analysis of the data we collected demonstrate that the perception of Computer Science that pre-university students have can be improved through specific training. Moreover, we can also confirm that the performance of pre-university students involving Computational Thinking skills is independent of gender, particularly at the primary education level.";

bibo:abstract "Collaboration skills are important for future software engineers. In computer science education, these skills are of-ten practiced through group assignments, where students develop software collaboratively. The approach that students take in these assignments varies widely, but often involves a division of labour. It can then be argued whether collaboration still takes place. The discipline of computing education is especially interesting in this context, because some of its specific features (such as the variation in entry skill level and the use of source code repositories as collaboration platforms) are likely to influence the approach taken within groupwork. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the work division and allocation strategies applied by computer science students during group assignments. To this end, we interviewed twenty students of four universities. The thematic analysis shows that students tend to divide up the workload to enable working independently, with pair programming and code reviews being often employed. Motivated primarily by grade and efficiency factors, students choose and allocate tasks primarily based on their prior expertise and preferences. Based on our findings, we argue that the setup of group assignments can limit students' motivation for practicing new software engineering skills, and that interventions are needed towards encouraging experimentation and learning.";

bibo:abstract "Computer science education in developing countries should take the cultural background of students into account. Not only classroom work or teaching practices, but also the science itself should be adapted into the cultural settings. Instead of trying to find problems in developing countries that western computer science could solve, the goal should be to use the science creatively to solve the problems currently at hand. This kind of cultural contextualization has to start from the educational level. If western philosophy is emphasized as the single right worldview, it definitely alienates the science from the culture it should help. We believe that appreciating the knowledge that students have about their world is invaluable when addressing the problems in their own countries. Fostering culturally bound ways of inferring, quantifying, classifying, representing, and measuring, will definitely lead to a better understanding of science because it supports the students' mental images. Also, this esoteric knowledge may well produce new ideas and fresh views on computer science itself.";

bibo:abstract "This paper describes the outcomes of a three-day teacher professional development workshop aimed at introducing concepts, principles and practices of computational thinking. The guiding research question for this study was: How teachers implement the backwards design process embodying elements of CS Principles (i.e., computational thinking big ideas and computational thinking practices) in the context of their classrooms? The participants of this study included 15 elementary, high school and college level teachers who are also graduate students from a master program in engineering. As part of the workshop participants developed a learning activity that included a set of learning objectives, the design of computational thinking related activities considering appropriate pedagogical strategies, and the integration of mechanisms to evaluate students' performance. Here we describe (a) how participants embodied the CS Principles in the design of learning activities to be integrated into their classrooms, (b) how they used the backwards design process as a tool to implement elements of the CS Principles and (c) what is teachers' performance in integrating CS Principles to the design of learning activities as evidenced by their peer evaluations. Finally, we propose the use of backwards design process together with the CS Principles as a framework for the design of computing learning activities and the development of teacher professional development programs in computing education.";

Yet, our experience led us to believe that the majority of these students lacked the skills to effectively use the library to perform independent literature searches, correctly estimate the credibility of different information sources, or properly write scholarly literature reviews. To address this problem, we attempted to teach scholarly literature review (SLR) techniques as part of a computer science graduate course. Our preliminary results showed that with a few carefully designed SLR modules and assignments, CS graduate students could quickly and effectively learn to use proper literature review techniques in their research projects. The improvement in student learning was obvious, while the amount of class time spent on the SLR activities led by the librarian instructor was modest";

bibo:abstract "Conducting an international summer program is difficult enough, but combine that with a project-based program that combines undergraduate and graduate technology and business majors from the United States, Europe, and China; working on real project for real companies and providing meaningful results in six short weeks; and you have a uniquely challenging program. The 15 program (immersion into international interdisciplinary innovation) is a program about technology innovation that itself had to be innovative to meet the growing ABET requirements for meaningful global experience for engineering and computer science majors. It also had to provide the learning experiences that would apply directly to the various engineering, computer science, and business fields to make it worthwhile and desirable for the students. While the coursework and various project plans were demanding, one of the real challenges came in the recognition and accommodation of the cultural differences and the language barriers within the teams, as well as those between the teams and their program sponsors. This paper will document the challenges faced in the deployment of this new study abroad program. It will also include an summary of the student evaluations, especially the impact of the program on the American, the European, and the Chinese students in terms of how they now approach their perspective of the world, different cultures, their chosen discipline, and their outlook on the future.";

By combining two simple open-source software, we managed to create several short tutorials on how to use various command-line security tools. The educational tool was deployed in an undergraduate cybersecurity class, and the results from the anonymous online survey were overwhelmingly positive.

bibo:abstract "A growing number of studies in the computer science and engineering communities are addressing mood, an affective phenomenon related but not equivalent to emotion. While emotion has been investigated intensely in the affective computing domain, the characteristics and applications of mood are relatively unexplored. Through a bottom-up approach, this paper aims to identify in which areas and for what purposes computer scientists and other researchers in the ACM and IEEE communities are studying mood. Based on a literature review of 1,264 peer-reviewed publications, this paper proposes a taxonomy of mood research in affective computing. Despite a wide range of applications and domains, core themes of mood research relate to identifying users' mood, influencing it, or helping users to communicate their mood to others. The conceptualization and definition of mood, however, vary between the studies surveyed and sometimes can fall considerably far from the psychological concept of mood in affect research. In several instances, researchers use the terms mood and emotion interchangeably and do not sufficiently discuss the implications both for their measurements and for the design of affective-computing systems as well. With our study, we aim to contribute a clearer conceptualization of mood research and to provide researchers with a broad overview of the research as well as areas of applications in which mood is addressed.";

bibo:abstract "One of the most ubiquitous techniques for evaluating research, particularly in educational settings, has been Likert-style questionnaires. Having a participant rank their level of engagement, agreement, or interest on a scale can provide powerful insight into an individual's perspective and attitude. However, as computing education matures as a discipline it becomes important for us to examine our practices and ensure that we are employing the techniques of evaluation properly. Likert-style questionnaires can be prone to unintentional biases and noise which, from the perspective of the researcher, may affect the study in unknown, unexpected, and potentially undesirable ways. In this research we seek to aid the computing education researcher not only avoid biases and noise but also improve the reproducibility of their work. First, we establish best practices for these instruments by synthesizing recommendations from the original creator, Rensis Likert, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), and the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR). We then considered additional sources of unintentional biasing and noise resulting from the measurement scales/response options, specifically possible biasing resulting from how response options are presented to the study participant. With these recommendations, we then examined 121 evaluation instruments used in computer science education research and curated in the csedresearch.org online database to see how often researchers unintentionally fall victim to the pitfalls of ambiguity, awkward phrasing, use of conjunctions, leading or biased statements, and double negatives. We found that the occurrence of at least one of these problematic statements to be in 82.6% of all instruments. We also examine demographic information for the intended study participants, number of response options, and how those options are presented. Overall, while we see many instrument authors falling victim to a few of these common pitfalls, we believe that increased awareness of potentially problematic statements/measurement scales and their impact on research bias and reproducibility will help insulate computing education researchers from avoidable complications and strengthen the discipline throughout.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: In a context where hands-on courses are biased toward specific technologies, a novel creativity-provoking instructional approach for networking undergraduate courses is successfully applied following action research principles and active and creative learning techniques. Background: Extensive engineering-oriented networking courses have been proposed with a strong focus on specific protocol solutions. At the same time, the amount and complexity of techniques is notably increasing with the advent of the Future Internet. As a result, the curricula looses focus on the fundamentals of networking algorithms. Intended Outcomes: We address algorithmic learning in networking for computer sciences, where students are expected to 1) create; 2) develop; 3) analyze; and 4) compare algorithms and processes regardless of protocol-specific technologies. At least 70% of the students are expected to meet this goal while enhancing their engagement and motivation in a time-constrained course schedule. Application Design: To achieve 1) and 2), we instrument an active experimental strategy, while objectives 3) and 4) are tackled with creative learning techniques, both applied in an action research framework. The approach is supported by state-of-the-art networking application interfaces and simulators. Furthermore, a blended and game learning component favors the engagement via comparison and competition of students' project metrics. Findings: The experiment is carried out by professors of the Computer Science Bachelor's degree taught in FAMAF. Results show that the applied methodology met the intended outcomes, and improved by 7% in a two-year cycle. Furthermore, the approach was very well received based on student's feedback.";

bibo:abstract "Increasing popularity of learning from the internet, the construction of perfect models for a learning environment that depend on the web has become one of the hottest points on researching remote education. The goal of implementing e-learning system in the educational process is a significant importance in achieving the State's educational development program in the Republic of Iraq. E-learning system exhaust lots of money for building infrastructures and applications. It is clear that cloud computing can relief Educational institutions to reduce their structure cost, software cost and human resources remarkably. This paper proposes a new web-based model for cooperative learning are developed based on cloud computing destined to facilitate and to reduce related costs with access, operate, and to mitigate the management of technologies and e-learning content strategies. The model consists of many modules (admin, course, personal, learning records, and communication) to support the implementation of cooperative learning. An experiment was conducted to two (self-form, random) groups’ students, to inspect the learning efficiency of the developed model. Results indicate that students were consistently learning consistently in both groups, which verified the utility of the developed cooperative learning system and interactivity has a significant difference, but social context and online communication has insignificant difference among three dimensions of social presence theory.";

bibo:abstract "In this era of smart devices, new technologies, gadgets, apps, and numerous systems and services available over online, teaching an introductory programming course by traditional lecture method faces challenges to draw student's attention; especially in their freshman year. In this work, we discuss our experience in teaching an introductory CS course by infusing both interactive and collaborative learning in pedagogy so that students can learn using interactive platforms, tools, technologies, systems, and services as available to them and collaboration within and among groups. For interactive learning, students used an interactive programming environment (e.g. repl. it classroom) as well as online eBooks. We designed several in-class exercises, assignments, small lab-based projects with example codes and expected outputs, and unit tests by using built-in unit tests library. We also, in the middle of semester, introduced collaborative learning through teamwork on well-defined projects during the learning time and submitted at the end. The collaborations include use of basic task management tools and multi-player tool of repl.it that the students can critic, supplement, improve peer works and learn. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey were conducted on student cohort in two different semesters. The initial evaluation of the survey results and performances (final project and final grades) show evidence to conclude that the proposed pedagogical approach increased student motivation and engagement and facilitated learning to entry-level computer science students.";

bibo:abstract "As the number of teachers teaching computer science grows, it is increasingly important to be mindful of the training they receive with respect to broadening participation in computer science. Through our program, we have trained over 50 teachers in the greater Boise Metropolitan region, who have in turn taught over 1400 students computing concepts through courses such as Exploring CS, AP CS Principles, and AP CS A. These courses have an excellent curriculum that contains a mix of computational thinking concepts such as a focus on creativity, abstraction, coding, as well as increasing awareness about the cyber footprint of the students with respect to security and privacy. While the curriculum is excellent, we need to be more mindful about incorporating pedagogical strategies that promote inclusive teaching especially for women and minorities who are traditionally underrepresented in computer science.To address the challenges associated with teaching a truly inclusive course, we developed a new course titled “Inclusive Strategies for Computer Science Education” that draws attention to the strategies that have been studied over the years in STEM and CS education literature. We present the contents of the course along with a post-hoc qualitative survey on the applicability and practicality of the material discussed in the course.";

dblp:publishedBy "IEEE";
bibo:abstract "This Research, Full Paper presents a study on the experiences of teaching assistants (TAs) in Computer Science (CS) courses. TAs are widely used in CS education, to reduce the workload of faculty. A way to allow smaller groups of students in tutorials and individual guidance in lab sessions, even though the numbers of students in the classes are increasing. The aim of this study is to describe the TAs, own experiences of their role, which work tasks they have and how they are carried out. Fifteen semi-structured interviews with TAs, who were themselves studying towards a bachelor's or master's degree, were carried out and analyzed using thematic analysis. The results indicate that the TAs typically work alone with preparing the material for the tutorials and that they are given a high amount of freedom both regarding which examples to explain and which pedagogical approaches to use. During the lab sessions the students conduct lots of different tasks, related to assessment and tutoring. In the paper, we present a framework with the identified work tasks, with descriptions on how they were carried out. The thematic analysis resulted in six role descriptions; as a teacher, friend, tutor, grader, mentor and apprentice. Combining the roles as tutors and graders, can be experienced as tricky, especially if the instructions and grading criteria are lacking details. The TAs can also view themselves as both a teacher and a friend to their students, which could cause conflicts of interest to arise. The TAs could experience to be an apprentice to the course coordinator and senior TAs, but also to be a mentor for the students and more novice TA colleagues. The implications of this study could be of use for faculty who employ TAs in their courses or are conducting or planning TA training sessions. Based on the result, we have made some recommendations for TA training.";

bibo:abstract "Concepts in computer science courses are among the most complicated to teach in developing countries institutions. This is because majority of developing countries' institutions are faced with large class sizes while teaching facilities are few. Although several solutions have been proposed to alleviate these problems such as increasing student-computer ratio, improving teaching pedagogy and increasing number of teaching staff, the problem still exist. Therefore we conducted a pilot study at UDSM determine if the use of animations and simulations can enable students to learn difficult concepts and master course contents. The study has revealed that 67% of respondents (of 108 students) indicated that animations and simulations in courses enabled them to grasp difficult concepts more easily. The study also found that the process of developing animations and simulations improves the quality of course design. However, it is essential that the pedagogical and instructional design principles be incorporated in the whole process of course development to realize the benefit and usefulness of the developed animations.";

bibo:abstract "Although the industrial partners of academe are unanimous in their desire to hire engineering graduates who are experienced in working productively in small groups, implementing small group work in a computer science class can be difficult. The obvious assignment, a group programming project, proved to be a poor choice when implemented in the author's computer graphics class. An examination of the literature in this area shows that a group programming project has many features in common with a group term paper, the assignment which has been uniquely identified as the worst choice for small group work. Fortunately, there are better choices for cooperative learning in computer science. Assignments with \"the three S's\": same problem, specific choice and simultaneous reporting of group choices, work well. This was implemented in a class by having students work multiple choice quizzes designed to require high level learning skills. Quizzes were first worked by individuals, then by small groups. The small group answers are then compared and discussed in class. This generates the type of interaction between the professor and students which creates positive cooperative learning experiences. Promising preliminary results have been seen with this method, from both the student and the professor's perspective.";

This theory generates a research programme. I examine the elements of this programme and assess progress. A large number of people world wide have been pursuing the type theory aspects of this research programme, so we can survey a large body of work created over a 20 year period for hints of success and failure and challenge. I first look at a few successes. Some of the applications we have attempted have not worked out as expected, and we don't know whether the fault lies with the type theory or elsewhere. I first describe a failure that is clearly not the type theory, but the state of the foundations of computational mathematics. Then we look at problems closer to the structure of modern type theories-problems suggested by the success of classical set theory.";

At the University of Brasilia, one of the top ten universities in Brazil, female undergraduate students account for less than 15% of the students in the Department of Computer Science. In an effort to understand the lack of interest in Computer Science majors among women, this paper addresses the following research questions: 1)Are female students in high school aware that Computer Science majors are predominantly male? 2)Are families of girls from Brasília supportive of their enrolment in Computer Science majors? 3)Do girls from Brasília think that Computer Science majors need a lot of Math? 4)Do female students in high school think that it is difficult to get a job in the field of Computing, with a good salary, and sufficient leisure time? and 5)Which factors influence a female student's choice of a Computer Science major? We devised a questionnaire and applied it to female students in middle and high school on two occasions, in October 2011 (1391 responses) and in July 2019 (429 responses). This paper presents the analysis of the data from the responses, which indicates that the girls' perceptions of Computing have not changed in those years.";

bibo:abstract "The CSforALL movement has made great strides preparing teachers in computer science (CS) with professional development (PD) toward broadening participation in computing. These opportunities develop teachers' understanding of CS content, alongside culturally-relevant practices and equitable access. However, while a focus on teachers is necessary, it is not sufficient for systemic, scalable, and equitable implementation. Comprehensive PD programs need to include teachers, school counselors, and administrators. This paper uncovers a statewide research-practice partnership's approach to a replicable multi-stakeholder PD model that addresses the following research question: How can a comprehensive CSforALL model effectively engage teachers, counselors, and administrators to work in unison to ensure equity sits at the heart of scaling and sustaining CS education for all students? A university-district research-practice partnership developed a week-long professional learning experience for teachers, counselors, and administrators that linked equity at the classroom, school/district, and policy levels. With the intentions of iteratively improving on the PD and learning about attendees” CS education interests and experiences, the RPP collected and analyzed observations, interviews, and surveys. Findings reveal (1) a multi-stakeholder comprehensive PD model has positive impacts for the capacity-building of CS education leaders; and (2) a focus on equity across all strands of the PD program develops a better understanding of why equity needs to be at the center of CS implementation, allowing different stakeholders to work together to recognize collaboration is needed to respond to the challenges faced at each level of implementation.";

bibo:abstract "The intention of establishing a so-called Green University is pursued in multiple countries around the world. While information technology has been a core enabler in several green initiatives, it will be worthwhile to observe how computing programs themselves educate their students in green technologies so that students graduate from such programs with a strong environmental focus. In this paper we examine how computing programs can help answer the following questions regarding a green program: (1) How to minimize a negative impact of the discipline's practices and technologies on the environment? (2) How to contribute the discipline's resources and techniques to increase environmental sustainability? (3) How to incorporate both aforementioned principles into the discipline's curriculum? Eventually, the authors attempt to build a model of education for computing programs for sustainable development, which will allow other educational institutions adopt practices that will help graduate environmentally conscious students from computing disciplines.";

As part of our efforts to improve the pass rates in these courses, we examine the students' mathematics preparation and their progress from one course to the next. We find that the minority of students who enter the university with good mathematics preparation are likely to succeed in our introductory computer science courses. For the majority of students, we suggest a series of interventions throughout the pipeline. Prior to taking Computer Science 1, students could gain more experience with problem solving during the Introduction to Computer Science and Introduction to Computer Engineering courses. We suggest adding precalculus as a prerequisite for Computer Science 2. For students who do not earn an A in Computer Science 2, we plan to examine whether taking a class in a second programming language before taking Computer Science 3 will improve performance in Computer Science 3. Our goal is to improve student learning and retention through these efforts, combined with continual innovation in the classroom.";

bibo:abstract "Experimenting in computer science course is challenging due to the limitation of site, equipment and special experiment tools. In this paper, based on the analysis of the experiments features of computer science curricula, such as, Principle of Computer Organization, Digital Image Process, Digital Signal Process etc., we design two kinds of virtual lab platforms and develop corresponding virtual lab systems for the courses in computer science curricula. In the first virtual lab, every experiment instrument in real lab is visualized as a Java component. In the other kind of virtual lab, the algorithm students learn in the course is packed as a Web Service component by C, C++ or Java. In both platforms, those components are listed in the system. Students is able to select Java components or Web Service components as the experiment they want to do need and integrate them by building connections between them. Then, the students can set input for the experiment in the input component. After click the button of rum, the result will be display for the students in the platform. In the two kinds of virtual lab, students can also write the code in the platform. After it is submitted, those codes will be transferred as a component by the platform and be added in the component list. Then they can use them as the components provide by the platform. So, they can test if the algorithm they write is correct. Both platforms are developed by Java Applet and can be run by a browse. By using our system, students can experiment at any time and any place via the Internet. Teacher is also able to do experiment in the classroom. Base on the platforms, 6 virtual lab systems have been developed and used by more than 5 universities in China. Those virtual lab systems have been received favorably by teachers and students.";

bibo:abstract "Research methods are perceived among the most challenging classes by students and faculty: in addition to theories, foundations, and technical aspects, they involve applying high-level critical-thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills. Simultaneously, methods courses play a significant and holistic role in contributing to the personal and professional development of students. Therefore, designing engaging and meaningful learning experiences is especially important, as research methods classes touch every dimension of student success. To this end, experiential learning (EL) approaches are among the most successful strategies adopted by faculty: in the last decade, the benefits of incorporating components, such as simulations, internships, service-learning, and fieldwork, have been demonstrated in several domains. Indeed, sharing diverse examples of applications of EL in methods classes in specific fields is beneficial for contributing to the discourse, generating new strategies, and identifying best practices. This paper presents the case study of a course in research methods in computer science entirely based on experiential learning. Specifically, the class was designed to match the critical steps of the scholarly publishing process. Throughout the semester, students generate and refine applied research projects that could eventually be published in actual academic conferences or scientific journals. The findings from three years of data demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach discussed in the paper.";

bibo:abstract "The offering of three-year academic programs has increased in the last five years, mainly due to their potential to decrease cost of college education; however, their overall effectiveness is still under debate. We report on an in-depth alumni survey of 50 college graduates from a 3-year cohort-based program (CSin3), one year post-graduation. Respondents are 91% Hispanic and 9% Caucasian. 36% are female and 82% are first-generation college students. At the time of survey completion, 84% were employed in a technical role, 4% were in a computing education role, and 11% were unemployed. While most students found a full-time position within the first two months after graduation, a few of them are still struggling to find a job in the field, citing challenges in passing coding interviews and finding employment near family. The most common reason alumni gave for accepting their first full-time position was having an internship with the company. The most common pressures and challenges that alumni reported facing professionally are: work-life balance, cost of living, lack of diversity, and stress in current position. Alumni who stayed local had significantly lower salaries and job satisfaction than alumni who moved out of the region for work. Outlook of alumni towards computer science is largely positive, with 86% very or extremely satisfied with their choice of pursuing a computing career, and 87% confident that they will continue in the computer science field.";

The study presents an exploratory case study that examined the perceptions of computer science students towards real-world problem solving. The participants were 72 computer science graduate students in a human-computer interaction course during two semesters. The students were immersed in a real-world problem solving educational situation. After, a quantitative study was conducted, with data obtained from a questionnaire. Data from the questionnaire revealed that the perspectives of computer science students concerning real-world problem solving are positive. The students recognized that the tasks were valuable, did not present difficulties, were engaged, had fun, attributed long-term importance, judged that the tasks fit their personal development, and it was worth to devote their time and resources. In summary, students in our samples hold the opinion that real-world problem solving provides a meaningful learning experience. The findings provide new insights into the opportunities of the application of real-world problem solving in computer science education.";

From these various affiliations, one can be lead to the following question regarding formal methods: are they part of mathematics, computer science, or software engineering? This paper tries to shed some light on this question. First, the major characteristics of these various disciplines are presented. UQAM students' background is also examined to see to which discipline they belong. Then, what are formal methods and how they fit in the software development life cycle is briefly explained. An outline of the formal methods courses that have been taught over the last few years is then presented, followed by an informal assessment of these courses.";

bibo:abstract "This innovative practice full paper presents a set of engaging actions aimed to encourage women to pursue a Computer Science career in a city of a third world country (Manaus, Brazil). Despite worldwide efforts to promote gender equality, typically, women account for less than 30% of the workforce in technological areas. In third world countries, the situation is much more unbalanced. Poor educational and economic conditions, allied with a chauvinism culture contaminated by sexism and stereotypes, are strong forces that repel the young girls from IT areas. As a result, the percentage of women in local Computer Science majors is lower than expected. The authors detail a program to involve girls from all school levels in computer science career, which is indeed the adaptation of a national program, combined with indigenous elements. The mentioned adaptation was a key success factor to catch the attention of students and local educators. Some activities that are included in this program are lectures at scientific, technological and gender discussion events, realization of dynamics in schools for the dissemination of computational thinking in children and young students, training students to take part in programming contests and develop knowledge into real computational applications. These actions resulted in highlights achieved in programming contests and prizes obtained through application development, and have provided a more conducive academic environment to discuss issues related to the female gender in science and technology fields. Besides the fundamentals of the program, the authors present the results of the last three initiatives, which happened in conjunction with local events, and the promising opportunities perceived in Computer Science major of a local university.";

Given these facts, it is crucial to help these minority groups become an integral part of the economic fabric of the United States. It has been shown that undergraduate research is one of the best vehicles to address several of these important issues. This paper describes our experience running a NSF-sponsored research experiences for undergraduates (REU) site in CS&E for under-represented minority student groups. We describe the most important aspects that need to be included in these programs and some strategies for running them successfully.

bibo:abstract "This research full paper presents two main outcomes: 1) a novel classification system for gamification implementations including proposed genres, and 2) a comprehensive study and categorization of existing DSA gamification applications and a discussion of genres absent existing applications. Gamification presents a great potential to improve user engagement, motivation, and learning in nearly all fields of study including computer science (CS) education. However, it lacks formalized study and comprehensive analysis in CS education, and thus what makes for effective gamification is still a key question. Rather than initially trying to examine and catalog existing gamification applications and studies across the breadth of CS education as a whole, this paper instead focuses on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) courses. In general, DSA courses tend to be difficult due to the inherent complexity and abstraction exhibited by the fundamental concepts. As such, gamification presents a potential opportunity to convey these complex ideas in meaningful and unique ways. To carry out this work, a literature review of current DSA gamification applications is presented, the applications are categorized, and the pros and cons analyzed. Based on this analysis, a classification system is created and two new abstract genres are identified: dynamic gamification and collaborative gamification development. Potential uses, benefits and detriments are suggested for these newly identified genres. With this analysis and classification of gamification along with the identification of new abstract genres, the practice of gamification in DSA coursework can be made more efficient and effective. Upon a more thorough understanding of DSA gamification, pedagogical considerations can be made to better aid teachers and instructors in the integration of gamification into existing curriculum. The paper also touches on the applicability of the classification system to CS gamification examples outside of DSA.";

bibo:abstract "There is an increasing interest in providing Computer Science (CS) instruction to a wider sector of the population. On the one hand, it would be convenient to include CS instruction in higher education beyond engineering disciplines, since CS has become a powerful catalyzer for development of society, and therefore the need for a workforce with solid CS background is growing. On the other hand, it would be beneficial to bring CS instruction to primary and secondary education, used as a vehicle to increase interest in CS and capture talent for STEM disciplines from early stages. However, successful delivery of CS instruction to a wide audience is a challenge. Game-based learning is one of the most promising approaches at the moment, since they have the power to appeal to wider audiences. In this paper we identify the need to find more scalable game-based instruction paradigms that can be easily adapted to variable levels of complexity and contents related to CS. We present a flexible and scalable game architecture, and a game model to create videogames for learning CS languages, along with a game engine developed as a reference implementation. The game model focuses on level-based games where the student has to introduce short text fragments or programs to solve each of the levels. This game model is consistent to others found in the literature (Scratch, Logo, etc.) that have proven it effective, since it allow students to discover programming in a self-exploratory way, using their own intuition and learning from their mistakes. Our approach is scalable because (1) it separates the CS language used to write the programs from the game design, allowing reusing the games with different CS markup or programming languages; and (2) it provides a system of levels that allows incremental learning of CS language structures. The approach was tested by developing \"Lost in space\", an educational game for learning XML. In this game, students control a spaceship, and their goal is to reach a safe point in each of the levels. They provide instructions to the ship with short programs that they write using XML-based instructions. At the beginning students can use a small set of instructions. As they master these types of instructions, new ones become available, supporting in this manner scaffolded learning. The game was tested with undergraduate students from computer science and social sciences, by comparing it with traditional instruction (i.e. lecture). Students who played the game were much more engaged than those who attended the lecture, showing a more active attitude along the whole experience and also spent more time practicing after class. Findings also suggest that the game was effective for instruction regardless of the background of the students. However, the educational gain observed with the game-based instructional approach, even effective, was not significantly higher than traditional instruction. We think that our approach is adequate to introduce CS languages in general, as well as new programming languages.";

bibo:abstract "Immunization is the process in which we fortify our immune systems by injecting just enough of an active agent so as to cause the immune system to gear up with the appropriate antibodies. This paper discusses a successful practice of \"HPC/PDC Immunization\" at the CS1/CS2 level. We have found that simply exposing students to threaded versions of solutions they have already solved \"fortifies\" their technical expectations so they assume parallel programming will be a normal part of their educational experience. In particular we look for interesting Monte Carlo Simulation problems for students to solve conventionally. These problems already exist in the current introductory textbooks. They are CPU-bound and embarrassingly parallel. At the end of the semester, an \"immunization lecture\" is given, showing students that some simple-looking OpenMP pragma's can release their already working solution to run across all the available cores on their machines. Upon seeing a System Monitor report 100% of the available CPU cycles running their code, the students' \"technical antibodies\" are launched, and they will demand to be shown parallel programming in the later courses. This project is part of the CSinParallel.org corpus of parallel teaching materials.";

bibo:abstract "As computing becomes more powerful and extends the reach of those who wield it, the imperative grows for computing professionals to make ethical decisions regarding the use of that power. We propose the concept of abstracted power to help computer science students understand how technology may distance them perceptually from consequences of their actions. Specifically, we identify technological intermediation and computational thinking as two factors in computer science that contribute to this distancing. To counter the abstraction of power, we argue for increased emotional engagement in computer science ethics education, to encourage students to feel as well as think regarding the potential impacts of their power on others. We suggest four concrete pedagogical approaches to enable this emotional engagement in computer science ethics curriculum, and we share highlights of student reactions to the material.";

This paper discusses the results of the survey and ties the findings to the literature. It focuses on: (1) who influenced students' decisions on picking a major or on changing a major (for example, friends, family, academic advisors, faculty, upper-division or graduate students, co-workers, and supervisors), and how did they affect students' persistence and (2) what is the impact of role models on student persistence. The analysis compares students who reported not having considered changing majors to students who considered switching to another major. The findings show that the students who did not consider changing majors reported having a stronger support system including faculty, academic advisors, and engineers who serve as role models. The data suggest that university faculty and staff need to reach out to the students who are deliberating about their initial choice of major and support the decision making process.";

However, the process is an essential step while modeling a virtual learning environment since a mapping between concepts and questions using mastery level assessment and recommendation engines is required. In this article, we investigated unsupervised semantic models (known as topic modeling techniques) to assist computer science teachers in this task and propose a method to transform Computer Science 1 teacher-provided code solutions into representative text documents, including the code structure information. By applying nonnegative matrix factorization and latent Dirichlet allocation techniques, we extract the underlying relationship between questions and validate the results using an external dataset. We consider the interpretability of the learned concepts using 14 university professors' data, and the results confirm six semantically coherent clusters using the current dataset. Moreover, the six topics comprise the main concepts present in the test dataset, achieving 0.75 in the normalized pointwise mutual information metric. The metric correlates with human ratings, making the proposed method useful and providing semantics for large amounts of unannotated code.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This article analyzes the learning and motivational impact of teacher-authored educational video games on computer science education and compares its effectiveness in both face-to-face and online (remote) formats. This work presents comparative data and findings obtained from 217 students who played the game in a face-to-face format (control group) and 104 students who played the game in an online format (experimental group). Background: Serious video games have been proven effective at computer science education, however, it is still unknown whether the effectiveness of these games is the same regardless of their format, face-to-face or online. Moreover, the usage of games created through authoring tools has barely been explored. Research Questions: Are teacher-authored educational video games effective in terms of learning and motivation for computer science students? Does the effectiveness of teacher-authored educational video games depend on whether they are used in a face-to-face or online format? Methodology: A quasi-experiment has been conducted by using three instruments (pre-test, post-test, and questionnaire) with the purpose of comparing the effectiveness of game-based learning in face-to-face and online formats. A total of 321 computer science students played a teacher-authored educational video game aimed to learn about software design. Findings: The results reveal that teacher-authored educational video games are highly effective in terms of knowledge acquisition and motivation both in face-to-face and online formats. The results also show that some students’ perceptions were more positive when a face-to-face format was used.";

Given the time constrains of the project, we had to help them to select the most feasible idea; (5) We applied a questionnaire to capture the perception of the students at the end of the project. It should be noted that all students successfully developed their music-based games using the digital music instruments and the Greenfoot Initial Learning Environment. In total four games were developed: (1) A game that allows drummers to perform ear training where they list to a particular drumming sequence and must replicate the sequence; (2) A game that allows guitar players to practice the execution of musical scales; (3) A game that allows keyboard players to practice their sight reading based on the simultaneous of two or more notes at the same time; (4) A game that allows bass players to practice their sight reading. It should be noted that by participating in the project one of the students acquired the skills and confidence to join the school and church bands.";

The authors taught in a hands-on lab setting where students use tools they have built, performing experiments that could extend the field. Hence undergraduates have firsthand knowledge of performing CS research using scientific methods. Second, a rigorous set of evaluation criteria developed in the Psychology Institute was utilized to evaluate how well students learn using our approaches. Ultimately, it is believed that this specialization warrants inclusion as an option in the standard undergraduate CS curriculum.";

bibo:abstract "Software engineering (SE) and computer science (CS) programs in universities worldwide are marked by a gender gap, which subsequently translates into a gender gap at the industry level. However, there are positive activities that can help attract more women to these male-dominant professions. This study maps the literature related to the achievement of gender balance in SE and CS university-level education and identifies future research directions. More specifically, this article reports on a systematic mapping study of female-inclusive SE and CS tertiary education programs. The authors collected 882 publications between 2015 and 2022 from five databases (ACM, IEEE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct), selecting 143 peer-reviewed papers for further analysis. The results showed that the main academic contributors were researchers from the USA. The majority of the publications contained observations and explanations regarding the gender gap in computing education. However, an important part of the literature considered proposals and practical activities for achieving gender balance in SE and CS programs. Finally, the authors classified the literature related to female-inclusive SE and CS tertiary education programs, identified the main research focuses and regional distribution, and considered ideas for future research.";

These studies illuminate both the difficulty and potential for motivating CS students, as well as the uniqueness of CS as a context for studying undergraduate motivation. Background: Computing disciplines are increasingly important in preparing the future workforce. It is imperative that CS educators understand how to motivate students and enhance student outcomes. Synthesizing findings across multiple studies allows for the emergence of new insights into student motivation and SRL. Research Questions: Which aspects of students' motivation and SRL are predictive of achievement and retention in CS and how can findings inform CS education? Methodology: The primary methodology is a comprehensive review of seven years of research on undergraduate CS education. Studies use a variety of analysis techniques, examine a range of constructs, and include multiple introductory and advanced CS courses. Studies of relationships between variables and change over time were conducted. Findings: The present synthesis of studies on motivation and SRL highlights the complex, counter-intuitive, and positive aspects of student motivation in CS.";

bibo:abstract "Keywords of academic papers are jargons shared within a research domain as well as a summary of the contents. However, the increasing popularity of the interdisciplinary research in academia in recent years opened a possibility that the choice of keywords would be no longer confined by the traditional domain boundaries. In order to investigate the evolutionary trends of keyword-sharing groups in academic publications, we applied three types of Social Network Analysis methods on the papers in the Computer Science domain collected from the Libra database. Particularly, papers published in 5 different time periods from 1970 to 2010 were targeted to show the change of keyword networks over time. The analysis results confirmed the increasing tendency in the keyword network to be absorbed by one big agglomerated cluster over time. As a result, the gatekeeper- or liaison keywords seldom exist in later times but coordinator keywords became majority.";

bibo:abstract "During the first year of computer science studies, students frequently experience difficulties, which can have multiple reasons. We have observed a tendency that students with computer science education at high-school seemed to be more confident and successful in their studies than students with a regular high-school education. As we experienced differences in particular during lectures, we were interested in both groups' perception during lectures that nudges students' way towards success or failure in order to identify possible pitfalls for students without computer science pre-education. To this end, we set up a mixed-methods research consisting of a pre- and post-term questionnaire as well as interviews and group discussions. We asked students about their experiences with teaching and during the first-year at our university. First results indicate that there are no significant differences in both student groups regarding the perception of teaching and teaching methods. However, students with no computer science high-school education are more likely to struggle with introductory coding classes, in particular at the beginning of their first term.";

bibo:abstract "The computer science (CS) education field is engaging in unprecedented efforts to expand opportunities in K-12 CS education, and to broaden participation of students traditionally underrepresented in CS. However, even as the field considers ways to provide access to high school computing in general, and the new AP CSP course in particular, one underrepresented group is often overlooked: students with learning differences (that is, students with specific learning disabilities and related attention deficit disorders, like ADHD). The national dialogue about broadening participation in K-12 computing education has given almost no voice to this population. As computer science education initiatives grow, K-12 teachers need evidence-based guidance about how to account for challenges specific to learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders so that these students who learn differently can access instruction and curriculum in ways that address their learning needs. This paper reports on the first phase of a National Science Foundation (NSF) supported exploratory research study (Grant #1542963) to address this problem. We describe our education research-practice partnership that aims to make CS more accessible for students who learn differently and in doing so, highlight the team's process of collaboration as a critical element to address the problem and support equitable learning in CS.";

bibo:abstract "Contests have long been used in computer science education to address themes such as artificial intelligence, video games, cybersecurity, computer programing, or robotics. However, the organization of these contests usually require a lot of resources and are very focused on a specific topic. Furthermore, there are a wide variety of gamification techniques that can complement traditional teaching activities such as points, badges, leaderboards and rewards. Prior research suggests that computer science students especially welcome these techniques, which represents a good opportunity for computer science educators. This paper presents a novel gamified learning activity that serves students to review the concepts they have learned throughout a computer science course. The activity has a contest format and makes use of multiple gamification techniques. The designed contest is performed face-to-face and uses points, leaderboards, and awards as gamification techniques. Specifically, the contest employs the dot-voting technique to collect students' votes and uses stickers and 3D-printed trophies as awards. The trophies were designed through the Tinkercad tool and printed by using the Ultimaker S3 3D printer. Moreover, an essential element of the contest that enhances its ludic aspect is that it is based on the usage of memes, which are audiovisual elements that represent in a funny way the ideas, thoughts or feelings of some people about a certain topic. The contest can be easily replicated and can address concepts related to any computer science course. The empirical validation of the contest was performed during two academic years with 72 computer science students of a database administration course. The obtained results, gathered through a survey, indicate that the perception of the participants about the contest was very positive. The students indicated that the activity helped them to reinforce their knowledge of the course and that it was extremely fun and motivating. Indeed, some students defined the learning experience as unforgettable.";

bibo:abstract "There are numerous initiatives to improve diversity within the computer science field. However, women still disproportionately drop CS majors and earn less than one quarter of CS bachelor's degrees in the United States. The extent to which CS students-especially male students-are aware of this gender gap is an open question. This paper reports on a study to investigate that question. We analyzed 325 CS1 students' survey responses and found significant differences between women's and men's awareness of the CS gender gap. Men were significantly less aware of the gender gap than women, and men had significantly milder beliefs about whether women experienced adversity in CS and whether there should be targeted efforts to support women. Twenty students (10 women and 10 men) participated in follow-up interviews after the survey, where they discussed their experiences and perceptions of the computer science gender gap. Even among students who were aware of the gender gap, many had a superficial understanding of its cause, believing it to be due to women having less natural interest in CS. We argue that these findings are a call-to-action: university CS curricula need to include diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training so that students have a more complete understanding of this complex issue, and so that these misconceptions do not continue to be perpetuated into the workplace.";

Despite its importance, many teachers and many studies report difficulties observed in learning of these subjects, resulting in a high rate of failure and lack of motivation among students. There are many experiments reported in the literature that attempted to solve this problem, such as: different pedagogical approaches, the use of special hardware like tablets, and the use of learning objects; however, all these formats are applied based on traditional classroom learning formats which results in the same type of result. Even some innovative approaches that did not present a formal validation of the process ended up losing as a methodology. Considering this scenario and the importance of this discipline in students' curriculum, we propose a blended model, that uses distance learning environments allied to new technologies, aimed to contribute with students performance and knowledge acquirement. In this blended model, one programming course was developed and applied to 92 students in computer science and engineering degrees, with course material consisting of video lectures and animations that were used to show and to explain critical concepts of the discipline where students often have problems. All this material was implanted by a Learning Management System (LMS), which showed statistical reports about all activities, including collaborative and interactive activities. We also used together with the LMS a dedicated community on Facebook and, in this article we present our analysis and some conclusions obtained by observing the interactions of students on Facebook and on LMS. We did a few meetings between students and teachers and also developed a methodology for tutoring with our tutors to improve our students' participation in the activities proposed during the course. In this paper, we describe the methodology in which we developed everything. We also present the results achieved in terms of students' performance and provides comparison with other students who attended conventional courses in programming.";

bibo:abstract "Contributions: The underrepresentation of women in computer science (CS) majors has long been a focus of attention in many academic documents, the majority of them from the United States and Europe. There is, however, a lack of information about educational interventions (EIs) for women in computing in Latin America. The contribution of this article is to cover this gap and describe what researchers in Latin American countries have been publishing about the recruitment and retention of women in the CS field. Background: Many EIs targeting female students at different educational levels—K-12, undergraduate, and graduate—have been undertaken to increase the participation of women in computing in Latin America. However, descriptions of these activities rarely are included in international academic databases. Research Questions: This literature mapping addresses two main research questions (RQ) about the topic of women in computing in academic publications in Latin American countries: RQ1) what are the characteristics of the publications about women in computing in Latin America? and RQ2) what are the published interventions to recruit and retain women in computing in Latin America? To answer RQ1, six subquestions were created covering year, language, country of origin, document type, and professional track. Furthermore, for RQ2, two subquestions were created involving educational level and the use of software development with a female theme. Methodology: This investigation used the systematic literature mapping process. To achieve a broad coverage of papers, the following sources were included: Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO, the proceedings of the Latin American Women in Computing Conference (LAWCC), and those of the Women in Technology (WIT) workshop colocated with the annual conference of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC). The included papers were published in the last decade (2010–2020) and written in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. Findings: The literature mapping encompasses 197 academic documents, 48.2% of which were written in Portuguese, 28.7% in English, and 23.1% in Spanish. The papers originated from 15 of the 20 Latin American countries. Brazil and Costa Rica have the highest number of publications overall. The documents describe initiatives to increase the participation of women in computing majors that cover the entire educational spectrum, from K-12 to graduate programs, but papers targeting populations in higher education have started to appear recently.";

bibo:abstract "In recent years, to meet the growing needs of upgrading computer-related competence of working adults, many online Bachelor of Science of Computer Science (BSCS) or Bachelor of Science of Information Technology (BSIT) degree programs have been created. However, how to effectively support these online students is still a challenge. This is due to special needs such as customizing the learning to individual backgrounds, supporting various programming and technical hands-on labs, and promoting teamwork engagement, etc. We have conducted a project integrated three initiatives to create an Online Learning Environment (OLE) suited to BSCS and BSIT degree programs: (a) using the adaptive learning software to customize the learning content based on each student's existing academic foundation; (b) using Amazon's Web Services to set up the hands-on labs; and (c) using discussion board assignments to promote the engagement of student-student and student-faculty, to train students to be competent in teamwork. The initial results of our project have consistently shown that all three initiatives mentioned above have a positive effect on students' learning. Our work has demonstrated that it is possible to create an OLE, which is not only cost-effective but also functionality proper, to the online BSCS and BSIT degree programs.";

Their preferred methods of information foraging has implications for the design of information retrieval systems for these researchers. Traditional indexing schemes based on controlled vocabularies see little use. Researchers rely heavily on browsing and citation searches-information gathering techniques that are not well supported by existing indexes and retrieval systems. Not surprisingly, resources that can be immediately accessed from the user's office (particularly via the Internet) are preferred to those requiring a special trip to another location (such as a university library).";

The official recognition of computer science in the French research and educational organizations met many obstacles, at least until the mid-1970s, although research and teaching had been carried on in this field for 20 years. In the CNRS, informatics emerged as a sub-discipline of applied mathematics and fluid mechanics, then of mathematics, before a specific assessment committee was created in 1976 for computer sciences and automation. In the university system, a subcommittee was established in 1972 and became a full committee in 1982; at that time, computer activities had already penetrated the secondary schools.";

bibo:abstract "Modern society is diverse, multicultural, and multifaceted. Because of these characteristics, we are currently observing an increase in the debates about equity, diversity, and inclusion in different areas, especially because several groups of individuals are underrepresented in many environments. In computer science and software engineering, it seems counterintuitive that these areas, which are responsible for creating technological solutions and systems for billions of users around the world, do not reflect the diversity of the society to which it serves. In trying to solve this diversity crisis in the software industry, researchers started to investigate strategies that can be applied to increase diversity and improve inclusion in academia and the software industry. However, the lack of diversity in computer science and related courses, including software engineering, is still a problem, in particular when some specific groups are considered. LGBTQIA+ students, for instance, face several challenges to fit into technology courses, even though most students in universities right now belong to Generation Z, which is described as open-minded to aspects of gender and sexuality. In this study, we aimed to discuss the state-of-art of publications about the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ students in computer science education. Using a mapping study, we identified eight studies published in the past six years that focused on this public. We present strategies developed to adapt curricula and lectures to be more inclusive to LGBTQIA+ students and discuss challenges and opportunities for future research.";

bibo:abstract "Student career prospects are critical for colleges and universities since it is frequently used as a criterion of success. Interestingly, the employment market scenario is changing faster than ever as a result of globalization, digitization, and recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Understanding the key factors affecting employability as well as the requirements of the new job market may be helpful to all educational institutions. Educational institutions all across the globe are eager to create, design, and make adjustments in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) curriculum that will help their graduates succeed in employment opportunities. Time-series analysis is a popular tool for predicting the future by analyzing previous data. In educational institutions, fact-driven and Machine Learning (ML) methodologies are frequently used. More and more research is looking at ML approaches for predicting employment prospects. This research explores the employability of CSE students in campus placement using a time-series method. Facebook Prophet (FBP) was used in this study to estimate the employability of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students in campus placement by taking into account two global parameters: over-hiring and recession. Facebook Prophet with global factors consideration was analyzed and evaluated in terms of accuracy. The FBP model with global factors consideration has yielded an accuracy of 93.6%. This study came to the additional conclusion that significant global issues, including the recession and overhiring during the pandemic, affected the placement status of CSE students.";

The lack of diversity in these programs affects the programs themselves, their students, but also society. This paper looks at alternative approaches to solving this problem by proposing a theoretical model that has Computer Science programs recruiting an Applied Sociologist that specializes in inequalities and engages local communities. The paper provides relevant discussion and examples of how an Applied Sociologist would affect diversity by being a liaison to the community and contributing to the curriculum. This unconventional concept is expressed through a case study that uses Seattle and the University of Washington to discuss the multifaceted layers of equalities brought on by history and current social practices.";

These concepts are especially suitable for programming novices and computer science non-major students. However, their broad adoption in universities requires access to affordable low-cost hardware. But for courses specific to the automotive domain, usually specific and expensive hardware and toolchains are required. Therefore, in this paper an approach is presented simulating real-world embedded systems by low-cost single-board computer hardware and allowing the students to focus on the essential elements of the system design. A customized teaching scenario including a laboratory vehicle based on low-cost hardware enables practical lessons in the area of \"Connected Car Applications\" (Car2x). The evaluation results demonstrate the practical feasibility and its strong acceptance and positive influence on the learning success.";

So, university life is a very important and precious time for a student. If a student passes this life with dissatisfaction, it has an impact on their future career. There are many reasons behind dissatisfaction of students in university life. After completing college life, some student gets a chance to admitted into public university and rest of them are admitted into national university or private university. In private university they are many subjects to choose for undergraduate study. But, in recants days most of the students choose Computer Science for their undergraduate study. Some students are satisfied with their choice and some are dissatisfied. So, in our research work we are trying to find out the reason for Computer Science students' satisfaction and dissatisfaction. We collect data from Computer Science students in different private universities in Bangladesh. We found 300 participants for our research work. We collect 300 student's data and we categorize them as satisfied and dissatisfied students. In this research work we are trying to show the systematic way of collecting satisfied and dissatisfied students' data. After collecting data, we try to process, analyze and visualize the data. Therefore, our goal is to find out the reason for students' satisfaction and dissatisfaction. We make a clean dataset of those data. And Machine learning algorithms can easily classify and predict output from those data. We hope that our dataset will be helpful for the machine learning researcher. And they get appropriate output from our dataset.";

bibo:abstract "The number of women in computing is significantly low compared to the number of men in the discipline, with African American women making up an even smaller segment of this population. Related literature accredits this phenomenon to multiple sources, including background, stereotypes, discrimination, self-confidence, and a lack of self-efficacy or belief in one's capabilities. However, a majority of the literature fails to represent African American females in research studies. The research presented in this paper used a mixed methods approach to understand the attitudes of African American middle school girls toward computer science and investigated the factors that influence these attitudes. The results show that African American middle school girls generally have negative attitudes toward computer science. However, after participating in a computer science intervention, perceptions toward computer science become more positive. The results also reveal that four factors influence the attitudes of African American middle school girls toward computer science, such as the participation in an intervention, the intervention content domain, the facilitation of performance accomplishments, and participant characteristics like socioeconomic status, mother's education, school grades, and the use of smart phones and video game consoles at home.";

bibo:abstract "Computing Support is the provision of academic supports such as individual tutoring and support classes to students studying computing at third level. Students can struggle with computing as it requires practice involving trial and error. This work proposes a research informed tutoring framework to support computer science students at third level. The tutoring framework combines three pillars; staff and training, pedagogies and activities. Support is put in place to help students develop technical and programming skills. Essential tutoring is provided for those who might otherwise drop out of college. The framework was applied to first and second-year undergraduate programmes and to the first semester in Higher Diploma conversion programmes. Results demonstrate that students' attendance has increased by 14%. In addition, student feedback shows that the framework supports students in computer science. This framework is a useful resource for academic managers that wish to implement computing support at third level.";

bibo:abstract "This Full Paper in the Research-category presents our initial findings in regards of students' implicit theories. Beliefs that people associate to themselves, often called implicit theories, self-theories, or mindsets, are a fundamental source of bias in human thinking. Research shows that implicit theories radically shape human thinking, behaviour, and progress. In the domain of education, implicit theories have significant associations to academic performance. In social domains, implicit theories are associated with development of social and soft skills, and groupwork behaviour. This article reviews the most significant research on implicit theories in educational and social domains, and shows significant research gaps in computing education. This article also summarises our previous findings, and presents new results from a sample of n =39 second year CS or computer engineering (CE) students in University of Turku, Finland, Department of Future Technologies. We investigated students' implicit theories and related association with academic achievement in first CS courses. Contrary to a lot of research, but in line with our own previous findings, we found that fixed implicit theories were connected with academic achievement. However, more data is needed to add reliability and confirm the results either way. The implications of implicit theories to development of soft skills are discussed, and a future research agenda is laid out.";

bibo:abstract "Broadening participation in computing research and initiatives have addressed the longstanding underrepresentation of various populations - including women, Black people, Latinx people, and persons with disabilities. Although there has been an increase in underrepresented populations participating in computing, there is still a need to further investigate and build on these efforts considering there is limited research on the participation of black boys. This position paper discusses the need for an increase in Black male participation in computer science and proposes a framework for developing an introductory computer science curriculum tailored for black middle school boys. This paper will support the proposed framework by identifying factors for how boys learn and the unique needs of black boys in an educational context; then merging those factors with effective strategies used for women and people of color participating in computer science.";

bibo:abstract "Ethical understanding and binding of members play an important role in the establishment of a fair and happy society. Whereas the ethical responsibility is more important for all technical professionals it becomes crucial for computer graduates. Because other technical professional interact more with the human and their activities are more visible to the society. Whereas computer graduates mostly interact with machines and many of the activities may not be visible easily or timely to other members of the society. Therefore, sound understanding and binding of the ethical values are essential for the computer graduates. The work is looking into the importance of ethical values inculcation in computer graduates, the state of ethical education in the computer curricula in the conventional learning systems and in the e-learning environments, and the agents which play a role in the ethical development of students. The work would also provide suggestions on how to inculcate ethical values in computer graduates based on the data and information collected from the students, teachers, academic experts and relevant members of the society.";

bibo:abstract "Artificial Intelligence (AI), with ChatGPT as a prominent example, has recently taken center stage in various domains including higher education, particularly in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). The AI revolution brings both convenience and controversy, offering substantial benefits while lacking formal guidance on their application. The primary objective of this work is to comprehensively analyze the pedagogical potential of ChatGPT in CSE education, understanding its strengths and limitations from the perspectives of educators and learners. We employ a systematic approach, creating a diverse range of educational practice problems within CSE field, focusing on various subjects such as data science, programming, AI, machine learning, networks, and more. According to our examinations, certain question types, like conceptual knowledge queries, typically do not pose significant challenges to ChatGPT, and thus, are excluded from our analysis. Alternatively, we focus our efforts on developing more in-depth and personalized questions and project-based tasks. These questions are presented to ChatGPT, followed by interactions to assess its effectiveness in delivering complete and meaningful responses. To this end, we propose a comprehensive five-factor reliability analysis framework to evaluate the responses. This assessment aims to identify when ChatGPT excels and when it faces challenges. Our study concludes with a correlation analysis, delving into the relationships among subjects, task types, and limiting factors. This analysis offers valuable insights to enhance ChatGPT's utility in CSE education, providing guidance to educators and students regarding its reliability and efficacy.";

bibo:abstract "First-year students are often not well equipped with the base competencies that are a necessary precondition for effectively acquiring complex new knowledge. Among others, these base competencies comprise self-organization, analytical thinking, or communication skills. Shortcomings in these competencies often lead to problems in the study process. To solve these problems, we need to investigate the students' initial competencies, in order to become aware of possible deficits, find ways to deal with them, and thus to enable students to reach their goals. Therefore, we developed a self-assessment on base competencies, an accompanying knowledge test and a questionnaire on personal information. The data collected by these tools was analyzed, searching for competence characteristics which influence whether our students persevere and participate in the final exam, or drop out early. The results of our data analysis support the assumption that both non-technical and technical competencies are crucial to study successfully. Correlation analysis has identified several characteristics which distinguish the students that participate in the exam from those who do not. Based on these results, we suggest ways to optimize university courses, teaching methods, and the support of first-year students to meet their needs.";

bibo:abstract "Computer Science is recognized as a young growing field compared with many other sub-degree and even undergraduate programs. Recently, many educators in this field teaching in community college as well as university have been recommended to redesign and restructure the program studies according to outcome-based teaching and learning approach. However, the issues related to how to define objectives and assess outcomes in this outcome-based approach (OBA) continues to be a challenge among the computer science faculty who are not originally trained in techniques for setting up objectives and measuring outcomes. In this paper, our experience of initial attempt in designing and developing our sub-degree computing program using OBA will be shared. Based on the OBA paradigm, we evaluate our teaching effectiveness and student outcomes based on the teaching evaluation results and their articulation success. Through deeper understanding and learning, outcome-based education can eventually bring a great impact on students and prepare them for both exciting career and successful articulation in the computing field.";

Installing Cosmic Rays detectors settled all around the Continent, from Mexico to the Antarctica, this collaboration is forming a community that embraces both high energy physicist and computer scientists. This is so because the data that are measured must be analytical processed and due to the fact that a priori and a posteriori simulations representing the effects of the radiation must be performed. To perform the calculi, customized codes have been implemented by the collaboration. With regard to the huge amount of data emerging from this network of sensors and from the computational simulations performed in a diversity of computing architectures and e-infrastructures, an effort is being carried out to catalog and preserve a vast amount of data produced by the water-Cherenkov Detector network and the complete LAGO simulation workflow that characterize each site. Metadata, Permanent Identifiers and the facilities from the LAGO Data Repository are described in this work jointly with the simulation codes used. These initiatives allow researchers to produce and find data and to directly use them in a code running by means of a Science Gateway that provides access to different clusters, Grid and Cloud infrastructures worldwide.";

Consequently, new academic programs have been proposed around the globe, aiming at establishing a framework within which students gain experience in the socio-technical process of designing information systems in business, libraries, health, government, education and beyond. These new interdisciplinary programs often regard computer science (CS) as one of their supporting pillars and therefore include some core CS courses, aiming at educating broad-minded practitioners rather than expert programmers in the field of information systems. This paper presents some thoughts on incorporating CS education in academic programs intended for non-CS majors and proposes an approach called `Program by Design' for the first CS course in a new undergraduate program in community information systems.";

bibo:abstract "Technology has developed such that it allows for effective remote collaboration. International collaboration gives students the opportunity to use different technologies for collaboration across time and distance as well as problem-solving experience with different cultures in a team-based environment. This paper investigates the interactions of highand low performing distributed student teams. These teams were involved in a software development project, part of a computer science course at two universities. A set of categories was developed for this study to examine the communication produced. This paper tracks the progression and changes in each team's communication via coded categories. In particular, the use of communication media available, the amount of communication per team and decision-making patterns throughout the software development process. Results indicate that not only is communication crucial to a team's success but the process and timing of specific actions can have an impact on a team's performance.";

Computer science research in India takes place at academic, government-sponsored, and industry-sponsored institutions. These major institutions can conduct effective research because they have sufficient funding, high-quality programs, good equipment, and an effective infrastructure. This is not the case at India's many other institutions. Many local observers say that Indian computer scientists make advances in existing areas of research but rarely do cutting-edge work. This occurs, in part, because many Indian computer scientists receive little direction and have few co-workers in their fields, which means they work in relative isolation.";

bibo:abstract "A new data structure called the Nano Version Control (NanoVC) Repo emerges from its origins in the fundamental data structures of computer science as well as from Git. It is acknowledged as a first-class data structure with the added benefit that the software industry already knows how to reason with it because of their experience with using it to version control software. The NanoVC Repo shines a light on the value of nano-scale modelling and in-memory representation of history. An initial implementation shows promising results where it out-performs Git implementations by 2–3 orders of magnitude. A parallel for fairness, transparency and explainability is made between Git (as used for versioning software algorithms) and the NanoVC Repo, which can be used for data structures. Applications of the NanoVC Repo are in computer science, storage and databases, data modelling, distributed and cloud computing, data quality, event streaming, artificial intelligence, and agent-based simulation. The hope is that this data structure is the next major step in computer science and artificial intelligence applications.";

bibo:abstract "The under-representation of women in IT has multiple possible causes, ranging from sociocultural aspects to individual dispositions and social attribution. This full research to practice paper explores secondary school students' (age 12–15) stereotypical perspectives of computer scientists and possible ways to challenge them. The major goal is to let young students form a more accurate concept of a computer science professionals by alleviating distorted images, often transmitted through media and the environment. Students who might not think of themselves as fitting in the prevalent stereotype of a computer scientist and may even lose interest in the field. Consequently, our approach challenges stereotypes in order to make any effort to raise young students' interest in computer science and in pursuing careers in this field. As part of this endeavor, we analyzed the drawings and descriptions of IT professionals made by 87 students aged 12–15 to determine what sets of preconceived perspectives and misconceptions are present in the learners' minds regarding persons in the IT profession. Our results have shown that that stereotypical views on IT actually exist in students' mindsets, but are subject to change when systematically challenged in a friendly and safe atmosphere. Aside of the scientific contribution, the paper aims to inspire and support educators in their efforts to help women and underrepresented groups in computing outgrow inaccurate stereotypes and to uncover young students' potential interest in the field. With this we aim to contribute to overcoming the gender imbalance and foster more equality in the occupational field of information technologies. Strategically, by creating a more sensitive, diverse and harmonious future that computer scientists knowingly and unknowingly co-shape.";

bibo:abstract "This full research paper presents a systematic analysis of 10 years&#x0027; student performance data of Computer Science (CS) majors at San Francisco State University, a public 4-year degree-granting university, aiming to address the ongoing challenges of early dropouts and low graduation rate. The main objective is two-fold: (1) gain a comprehensive understanding of how the existing curriculum has been supporting (or hindering) students&#x0027; progress towards graduation; and (2) suggest data-informed curricular changes. To this end, we utilize both explorative statistical analysis and data mining/machine learning approaches to first learn how individual courses and the prescribed course sequences influence a student&#x0027;s dropout/graduation status, and then build machine learning models to interpret/validate the observed interdependency among key courses in the current curriculum. Such patterns/models are consequently utilized to suggest impactful curricular changes towards reducing early dropouts and improving the overall student success as measured by graduation with a CS degree. One main finding of this research is that a successful CS student needs to excel in both critical thinking and core CS skills. To help students gain critical thinking skills, it is essential to strengthen the presence of mathematics and physics courses in the CS curriculum. Furthermore, our results suggest that CS students without a solid math foundation before starting their college career should complete a remedial math course earlier than putting it off for later. Moreover, before students advance to the second half of their CS study to gain core CS knowledge/skills (e.g., operating systems), they should complete the required physics class. Finally, we observe that it is necessary to introduce new prerequisite requirements among upper-level CS courses, for example, Operating Systems as a prerequisite to an upper-level CS core course on programming theories.";

The course takes a holistic approach to broaden knowledge and deepen understanding of the domain of cyber security using cross disciplinary teams to gain understanding and experience taking theory to practice and practice to theory. A framework of understanding is built through the examination of the body of scholarly conceptual and technical works and hands on experience with hardware and software platforms and networks. Computer Science provides the theoretical underpinnings and technical details, methods, and tools to examine security concepts; Forensic Science provides the approach to critical analysis of digital evidence; and Behavioral Analysis provided a way to synthesize knowledge and scientific method to gain some understanding of criminal behavior as well as the breadth and economic impact of cybercrime. This approach resulted in students who gained technical proficiency and perspective and experience working with people with divergent backgrounds, abilities and knowledge sets.";

dblp:isbn "978-1-6654-6245-7";
dblp:bibtexType "Conferences";
bibo:abstract "This Research Full Paper presents a literature review on introductory CS assessments. As Computer Science (CS) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory CS courses to follow the trend. However, students have different levels of exposure to CS when they start CS in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. This disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. In the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. CS professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. Therefore, CS departments need an assessment to measure students’ CS knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate CS introductory courses. Though a vast number of research papers discuss CS introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students’ background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory CS contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students’ understanding of introductory CS concepts, and some existing assessments/concept inventories. By reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. We collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. We found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. Multiple-Choice and Code Writing questions, which are more popular than Code Explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students’ knowledge. Scratch is commonly used as a CS0 assessment language, while Python, Java, C, and Pseudo-codes are employed in CS1 assessments. FCS1, SCS1, and BDSI are existing assessments/concept inventories for CS1 or CS2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of CS0 (computational thinking), CS1 (fundamentals), and CS2 (data structure). Designing a comprehensive CS0/CS1/CS2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use.";

We have considered a base methodology but in each subject a variant of it has been accomplished. We have used several evaluation techniques, such as reciprocal evaluation, electronic portfolio and check lists. Applying our methodology helps us to detect learning problems before the term ends. Also, in tune with the framework of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), our methology gives a boost to develop transversal competences as important as work (or study) management, empathy and understanding of other members in a workgroup, conflict resolution, capacity to make decisions as well as coordinate and communicate with other members in a workgroup and also with the professor.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This article proposes and applies a new systemic 3-D model and a methodology for empathy awareness and development, integrating different partial approaches found in the literature for developing empathy as a transversal competence. Background: Empathy is a competence linked to collaboration and teamwork. Perspective taking (PT) is an important component of empathy and it is key for professionals today. Even though empathy is valued in computer science engineering (CSE) courses, it is not yet fully addressed as an integral part of the training process. Intended Outcomes: Both the model and the methodology are put into practice with a group of first-year CSE students, highlighting the possibilities of the proposal for this course of studies. The experience presented here is an example of a classroom activity in which awareness and PT are addressed, as key components, in relation to the collaborative work toward achieving empathy. Application Design: The methodological proposal is applied to guide educators’ decisions so that they can work on empathy in the classroom. Responses to several standardized and ad-hoc questionnaires by students from two universities are analyzed. Findings: The results revealed low to medium empathy levels in participating students, but a higher perception of their own empathic ability. The proposed methodology allows students to become aware of and develop some initial changes in relation to empathy, particularly in its PT component, through classroom work.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This study presents the results of a systematic mapping on the classification and organization of open educational resources (OERs) focused on Computer Science Education (CSEd) in digital sources. Background: The number of open resources (e.g., images, videos, and websites) available on the Internet for the teaching of Computer Science has increased in recent years. As a consequence, several authors have proposed different ways of classifying them, which include lists of disciplines, classification algorithms, and semantic enrichment. However, such studies are dispersed and fragmented in the literature, making the current state-of-the-art unclear. Research Questions: 1) What digital sources have been used to classify OERs for CSEd? 2) What CSEd domains have been explored for the classification of OERs? and 3) What approaches have been adopted for the classification of OERs for CSEd? Methodology: Three search strategies were performed: 1) automatic search in the five major digital libraries of CSEd; 2) manual search in the major CSEd conferences and journals; and 3) snowballing on the references and citations. As a result, 22 relevant studies were selected. Findings: The main findings were systematization of the main OER sources for CSEd, identification of 64 CSEd domains covered by OERs organized in a taxonomy, the immaturity level of investigations and tools, and lack of mechanisms that organize OERs for CSEd.";

In terms of sheer numbers, women came much closer to achieving equality in East German universities than was the case in the capitalist West, making up half or more of students in software-related majors. The East German social state was, moreover, set up in such a way that women could readily combine motherhood and a career. None the less, there was pervasive discrimination against women in hiring and promotion. Moreover, gendered thinking molded the day-to-day work experiences and professional lives of women in the information technology workforce in more subtle ways.";

We consider the research activity as a series process with two components, where the first component portrays the research productivity and the second component portrays the impact of the research outcomes of each department. The analysis is based on the data drawn from the Research Excellence Framework 2014 (REF 2014), which is the system for assessing the quality of research in the higher education institutions of United Kingdom. We carry out the assessment by employing the composition approach of Network Data Envelopment Analysis (Network DEA). Also, we encompass a qualitative aspect into the exercise based on the categorization of the publications provided by REF 2014.";

bibo:abstract "In many societies the chain between women and Computer Science has seemed, until now, one that has often asked for intermediaries. It is a reality supported by statistics, but by taking realistic measures for medium and long term, we can change the current situation. The present paper conducts an extensive study on women engaged in study or work at MSc, PhD and academic staff level in the CS field. Multiple factors that support or prevent women in Romania from attending advanced studies or pursuing an academic career in Computer Science have been identified and analyzed. Thus, through the obtained results, we aim to make an impact on decision-makers at the local level of higher education institutions, while good practices can constitute a starting point for other institutions interested in tackling this gender gap.

bibo:abstract "Reseachers have investigated numerous factors influencing citation counts of cited papers. One factor investigated has been the number of gained citations, as this could increase the visibility of cited papers and subsequently induce further citations. In this paper, aiming to identify a particular kind of citation that could trigger a rapid growth in the citation counts of cited papers, a concept of “citation promoter” was proposed. We defined citation promoters based on the annual citation rates of the cited papers and the co-citation counts received by the pair of cited and citing papers. The comparative results showed that papers would obtain a sharp rise in citation counts shortly after they were cited by citation promoters. Papers that received citation promoters at an early age outperformed other papers in long-term citation counts. In addition, we developed a classification model for predicting whether a citing paper would be a citation promoter for its cited paper. Since it was a class imbalanced problem (4 percent positive instances), and there was a lack of content and author features in our dataset, our preliminary models achieved moderate performance with an F1 score slightly higher than 0.5, while the F1 score obtained by random guessing was 0.07.";

Based on analysis of qualitative data gathered over 15 months of one district's efforts in this area, our findings illustrate how varying conceptualizations of equitable CSed are at play during institutional change processes in a school district, and how negotiation and management of differing equity-related goals takes place within CSed systems change efforts. The implications of this work point to the need of district-wide CSed efforts to engage stakeholders from across levels in the system in the process of planning and implementation. Additionally, we see a potential need for deliberative routines where various conceptions and attendant goals around equity—both related and unrelated to CSed $---$ can be understood and negotiated among district actors.";

bibo:abstract "ABET-based program outcomes are the skills and knowledge that a student successfully completing the program has obtained at the time of graduation. For a Computer Science program, many of these outcomes require a developmental progression of learning experiences that are best provided incrementally across courses. Achievement of such a progression is predicated on a cooperative effort by faculty to define effective approaches to realizing the outcomes. However, the progression must also minimize demands on individual courses and eliminate unnecessary restrictions on faculty discretion in course design and implementation. In addition, a time-phased assessment plan should be overlaid upon the progression to measure and track the developmental process. This work documents our effort to define a developmental progression in our computer science program to better achieve ABET-based outcomes, integrate the progression into an existing curriculum in a minimally invasive manner, and incrementally assess the effectiveness of the approach.";

bibo:abstract "Active learning refers to instruction where the learners play an active role in learning and has been found to increase student retention, improve acquisition of higher order thinking and reasoning skills, and improve performance in STEM courses. Two main active learning techniques: student response systems (aka. clickers) and flipped classroom assignments, were incorporated in University of Michigan-Flint computer science (CS) courses. This paper describes how clickers have been incorporated in CS courses and their impact on student learning. There are several ways of evaluating student learning, and tests have traditionally been considered an incomplete and limited reflection of the students' knowledge. In our prior work [11], students' metacognitive knowledge has been used as an effective measure of students' learning. Metacognitive knowledge can be considered to include knowledge of the person, the task, and the available strategies. In this work, we want our students to be aware of their level of understanding of the topics in a course. A student can use this knowledge along with knowledge of the task and available strategies to achieve the cognitive goals. This paper studies how clickers participation impacts student learning as measured by metacognitive knowledge.";

bibo:abstract "Recent studies at California State University, Northridge using the Kolbe Atrade index have shown differences in conative profiles between computer science students near graduation and those just entering the program. Since conation, or a person's inherent talent or natural way of doing things, relates to how a student approaches learning, it may provide clues as to why some students quit the program prior to graduation. The Kolbe instrument used in this study is a tool for measuring conative talents. It has been widely used in industry to aid in management activities and assist in the formation of effective teams. Its use in education has been limited, but it has potential for providing insight regarding differences in student learning and in understanding issues related to student retention. For example, one recent study showed a significantly higher implementor conative instinct among entering students than existed among graduating students. This suggests that some students with strong implementor talents may have dropped out of the program, possibly because they were not given sufficient opportunity to engage in \"hands on\" activities. It may be that some students are discouraged from continuing in the major because they find the learning environment incompatible with the natural ways they approach learning";

bibo:abstract "When presented with results and evidence that clearly show how teaching and learning can be improved, it is not uncommon for such ideas to be rejected because of personal experience, inter-disciplinary suspicion or because the information seems to completely counter all previously accepted wisdom. Such behaviour in students could be classified as a reaction to alien and counter-intuitive knowledge, as described in the works of Meyer and Land on threshold concepts. Since the threshold concept is, itself, a product of educational research, we would expect to have difficulty in explaining this concept to our colleagues. This is one possible explanation for the relatively slow penetration of computer science specific educational theory into modern computer science teaching practice. In this paper we examine the application of the threshold concept theory to the whole of our field of education, using the literature to find examples of how troublesome knowledge does, or does not, spread throughout the academic community. We track the adoption and display of knowledge of key concepts in Computer Science educational research, in order to identify common patterns in adoption and, by providing models to explain the flow of information across our discipline, provide an early indication of the role that threshold concepts (as a barrier to understanding) are playing in the community.";

bibo:abstract "This work is devoted to presenting some strategies aimed at incrementing the students' commitment with their formative process and, at the same time, achieving a satisfactory evaluative procedure. The strategies described in this work have been applied in the subject \"Computer Structure and Technology\", which corresponds to the BSc in Computer Science syllabus at the University of Almería. Broadly speaking, the subject delves into internal aspects of computer operation, such as several devices found in the computer data path, memory organization, and the control unit. These issues are frequently very unpopular among students because they are not familiar with the deepest level of the operations and, therefore, they usually need to dedicate a huge amount of time and effort to understand them. For these reasons, a student's level of competency at the endo of the course is not usually very high and many students even drop out of the subject in its early stages. To overcome this situation, we have introduced two novelties in the learning methodology. On the one hand, we have taken advantage of possibilities that the Learning Management System of our university (Blackboard) offers using Learning Analytics to find out what activities are more relevant from an academic result point of view. On the other hand, we have proposed evaluative mentoring to personally deal with the students' necessities. Thus, the methodology combines the advantages of both, online and on-site activities. As an obtained result, we have studied the validity of the methodological strategies, detecting the issues that have more impact on the assessment results. This fact is very helpful to focus our attention on these issues in the following academic years. Moreover, we have demonstrated a significative improvement in students' competency levels with respect to previous academic years in the same subject and other subjects of the same course.";

bibo:abstract "The high relevance of IT skills for most job profiles today requires to teach computer science and software engineering topics to an increasing number of students from non-major computer science programs (i.e. business administration). Due to their different knowledge and motivation this is a special challenge and requires suitable didactical methods and concepts. Since the research literature on this issue is sparse, the present paper provides a first overview about these challenges and methods and presents results of a first analysis of selected methods in practice.";

bibo:abstract "Career guidance is commonly viewed as an integral part of university services in the United States. Typically, this work is conducted through a dedicated office that provides professional guidance in such areas as: resume writing, interview preparation, and job hunting. While these are all essential to a student's career development, students in the computer science discipline have additional needs that are not part of this general guidance. This need is due to the fact that a typical computer science program contains multiple, and often very different, concentration areas. This paper introduces the idea of how career guidance can be implemented at both the departmental and course level in the discipline of computer science. We are proposing a four-step strategy that is integrated into a student's four year computer science curriculum. As part of this idea, a required first year seminar course will help to introduce core concepts in each of the concentration areas found in the computer science degree within the respective department. In the student's sophomore year, a career planning module named “You and Your Options” will be embedded into various classes to help further expose the students to their career possibilities. During their junior year, students will have opportunities to be engaged in service-learning projects where their soft skills such as time management, conflict resolution, problems solving, and communication can be developed. Finally, in their senior year, a capstone or internship course will be required for every student in which they will complete a project that combines knowledge and skills from at least three areas in computer science. We believe that this approach will allow each student a deeper understanding about their specific strengths in the different concentration areas and provide them a more well-rounded experience. This proposed plan systematically and purposefully guides students in understanding their own strength and helps to identify areas of improvement, in both hard skills and soft skills. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through both positive feedback from former students and employers, as well as quantitatively through increased job placement rate of graduates.";

bibo:abstract "A course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) involves the incorporation of research at the under-graduate level, typically as a replacement to the lab portion of the course. A motivational driver for incorporating research in the classroom is to ensure greater participation and retention of undergraduate students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Studies have also shown that students who engage in undergraduate research experiences gain a better understanding of the scientific process and are more likely to pursue graduate studies. The CURE model is regarded as a pedagogical paradigm that originated in the life sciences, resulting in numerous research studies and support networks. Computer science can be regarded as a singular discipline and as a discipline that spans all areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Interestingly, it was the STEM Education Act of 2015 that resulted in the official inclusion of computer science to the definition of STEM disciplines. This paper provides a review of undergraduate research experiences in STEM from the research literature, identifying the unique challenges and opportunities associated with incorporating CUREs into an undergraduate computer science curriculum. In addition, this paper entails an evaluation of an upper-division Artificial Intelligence (AI) course incorporating course-based research.";

While describing the proposed teaching method, it addresses relevant questions about teaching VLSI design to students in computer science and related fields. The approach involves the analysis, simulation, design and effective construction of processors. It is enabled by the use of both, VLSI hardware prototyping platforms constructed with reconfigurable hardware and powerful computer aided design tools for design entry, validation and implementation. The approach comprises a 4-hour a week lecture course on computer organization and a 2-hour a week laboratory, both taught in the 3rd semester. In the first two editions of the course, most students have obtained successful processor implementations. In some cases, considerably complex applications such as bubble sort and quick sort procedures were programmed and run in the designed processors.";

Though numerous efforts are being made by institutions, industries, and the community, many challenges still prevent widespread K-12 CS education. Our research aims to alleviate these challenges with a new adaptive learning system to teach introductory programming in a unique and interesting way. Adaptive learning strategies normally adapt based on a student's previous knowledge, pace, or learning style. Our research takes a new approach to adapt the content, practice problems, and examples based on a student's interests. Interest-based learning has been shown to improve intrinsic motivation, leading to better learning and achievements. This paper outlines how SAIL - a System for Adaptive Interest-based Learning - could impact introductory CS education and alleviate many of its challenges.";

bibo:abstract "Courses of computer science undergraduate studies are usually classified in two main groups: core and elective courses. The former are mandatory and students must pass them all so they can achieve Bachelor degree. The number of the latter is usually several times greater than the number that a student should select. This challenges the student which elective courses to select. Some elective courses have prerequisites, so the student has to pass other (elective) course(s), while for many others the student can be enrolled in without any prerequisites. The main dilemma for the student is whether to enroll in either more tightly coupled elective courses, or more loosely coupled elective courses. Choosing the former, the student will be directed in more specific areas of computer science. However, there are students that would like to learn broad areas of computer science. This paper focuses on the emerged group of students that select interdisciplinary courses. The experience presented in this paper shows that these students enroll into three completely divergent courses: Microprocessors and Microcontrollers, Software Architecture and Design and Human-Computer Interaction. The paper presents the examples of interdisciplinary projects completed by these students. These complex projects are proposed in the Human Computer Interaction course for the students that have already successfully taken the Microprocessors and Microcontrollers and/or Software Architecture and Design courses. Some students have accepted the challenges to work on the interdisciplinary projects, which resulted in defining and finishing various diploma theses that integrate knowledge areas of two or even all of the three courses.";

bibo:abstract "This full-paper relates to research on the effectiveness of GPA thresholding as a predictor of eventual grade performance in engineering study. Rather than rely on High School grades as a predictor of eventual success in tertiary (ICT-related) engineering, we have adopted a more open-entry model, but require a high performance from the students over their compulsory first year courses in order to progress in engineering study. In this paper we examine whether this is a satisfactory predictor of eventual student success (based on grade performance), or is it that issues such as High-School to University transition unduly negatively influence these grades and lead to a decision not to allow an otherwise capable student to progress. To examine this, we compare student GPAs and graduation rates between a four year Bachelor of Engineering and a three year Bachelor of Science degree which share similar courses. The hypothesis to test is whether students who have been excluded from continuing with Engineering study are in fact capable of passing the advanced level technical courses.";

bibo:abstract "The rigorous, structured, and transparent review of literature on a particular topic can lead to promising insights about research directions, practical solutions, and potential policies. While the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a well-established methodology, it is rarely used in the field of engineering education. Though the use of the term “systematic” suggests a clear-cut process and there are resources available to describe the major steps of the method, the initial steps of a SLR are inherently messy - i.e., they heavily rely on the researcher's judgement and decision-making. Unfortunately, the messiness embedded in these steps is rarely discussed or described in existing resources. In this study, we reflect on the “messiness” of initiating a SLR on broadening participation in engineering and computer science. Informed by two existing approaches to reflection, we used the STAARA (Situation-Task-Affect-Action-Result-Aftermath) framework to reflect on the ways in which we resolved important decisions associated with one overarching situation and several corresponding tasks, affects, actions; the aftermath is also discussed. This paper includes insights from our experience that can help other researchers navigate the initial steps of a SLR.";

Recent data has shown a gross underrepresentation of African Americans and other minority groups in computing and technology at the Masters and Doctoral levels. With a greater demand for diversity within the field of computing, it becomes more prevalent to find the causes for a lack of participation of such populations at the post-secondary level and find solutions to help increase the numbers. The study conducted looked at students' knowledge and experience in conducting and presenting research as well as their academic capabilities and programming experience. The study also probed the students about their knowledge and confidence in applying to graduate school and if they feel their inner circle was sufficient in preparing to apply. Our findings from the survey revealed that although the participants appeared to meet the academic requirements and had some level of research experience, they indicated that they did not possess much knowledge about nor feel confident in their ability to get into a graduate program. Findings also showed that the students know of people they can seek out to learn about graduate school, but most of them do not hold a Ph.D. At the end of the paper, current practices that help to provide students with the knowledge, confidence, and ability to pursue graduate studies in computing are reviewed.";

The college is a liberal arts college that values service to the community and is situated in Manchester NH, a refugee resettlement area. The three STEM programs are part of the Access Academy run by the college's center for community engagement. The Access Academy aims to help refugee, immigrant, and underrepresented students graduate high school, and to help them with the college application process. The STEM component is one of the four focus areas of the academy. The goal of the STEM programs is to expose the participants to science, computing, and technology and to broaden their perspective on the importance of these fields in today's world. The paper discusses three different programs: (i) Biodiversity Mapping using GPS technologies; (ii) Computer Construction; and (iii) A Computational Approach to Problem Solving. Surveys, as well as in-depth interviews were used to measure student attitude toward STEM disciplines. Although these were only preliminary surveys, most students seemed to have increased their interest in the STEM fields as well as their interest in pursuing a college degree. These programs were easy to setup and could be replicated at other institution across the country.";

bibo:abstract "The architecture of current microprocessors has suffered a vertiginous evolution in the last years, leading to the development of multithreaded multicore processors. The inherent complexity makes teaching students how current processors work a complex task and this has led most universities to study superscalar or multithreaded processors in a very simplified manner. This situation aggravates even more at lab sessions. Due to this fact students have a faraway view from real working of current multicore processors. To deal with this hard shortcoming, we designed a new methodology to approach students to real processor hardware, that has been successfully used at the Universitat Politècnica de València. The methodology is based on the use of a very detailed and accurate simulator that provides support to simulate all the main components of current microprocessors. Due to the simulator complexity, it is introduced through several phases in a progressive manner, which leads the students to achieve a solid learning about how current processors work, even including the a detailed model for the on-chip network that connects the cores of the system. Results demonstrate that students are able to use the simulator in a reasonable time period, and understand at the same time the more complex concepts of commercial processors. Furthermore some of them have been able to developed projects with the studied simulation framework that have been published in top international research conferences, such as PACT and IPDPS.";

bibo:abstract "Research into students’ conceptions is inherently challenged with appropriately transferring profound research questions into suitable research instruments. This applies in particular, but not exclusively, to studies with primary school students. In order to investigate individuals’ conceptions, besides linear-linguistic questionnaire procedures, classically guided interviews are used, also triangulated with each other or further sub-instruments (e.g. concept mapping techniques). For this latter purpose, seek-and-find-drawings offer a good opportunity, both paper based and digital. This paper presents research on primary school students’ conceptions of computers in everyday objects and illustrates a methodical opportunity regarding the use of seek-and-find-drawings in Computer Science Education research. In the presented study, 60 primary school children were presented with a seek-and-find-drawing depicting several everyday encounter situations with computing systems. According to the results, primary school students understand not only personal computers, smartphones, tablets, video gaming consoles and (video) cameras, but in few cases also refrigerators, air conditioners and cars as systems containing (embedded) computers. The experience from the presented paper based hidden objects study can be used especially for future research projects.";

bibo:abstract "About 2 million new scientific papers are published yearly. This leads to difficulties with extracting information and searching texts. This paper proposes creating “CSAC” annotated corpus of computer science research papers' bibliographic information, such as title and abstract. The corpus uses an XML schema to apply two types of annotations: structuring and semantic annotations. First, IMRaD format is applied for structuring the abstracts. Second, ontology is used to semantically annotate the different properties of algorithms in the abstracts. Applied linguistics is discussed to investigate the possibility of semi-automate the annotations. Since this paper claims that our methodology improves writing and searching the abstracts of computer science research papers, we propose to evaluate these claims via developing an online application based on “CSAC” that allows the users to, first, classify the sentences of their abstracts and, to second, search for specific algorithm using one of is properties. Last, a survey will be conducted to measure the users' satisfaction of using the proposed application.";

dblp:title "Serving with engineering skills within 15 miles of campus: The Scholars of Excellence in Engineering and Computer Science program";
bibo:abstract "The Scholars of Excellence in Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) program initiated its first cohort of 20 students in fall 2009. Funded for two, five-year awards through a National Science Foundation (NSF) S-STEM grant, the interdisciplinary, multi-year, mixed academic-level program offers scholarships to students based on academic merit and financial need. The goals of the scholarship program are (1) to increase the number of academically talented, but financially disadvantaged students in the stated majors, (2) to assist students to be successful in their undergraduate education, and (3) to foster professional development for careers or graduate education. A hallmark principle behind these goals is to build a broad scope of engineering and professional skills which include interpersonal communication, client-focus, and community-service, knowing technical skills are readily developed in the students' academic courses. The SEECS program is delivered through the activities of a zero-credit seminar. The SEECS seminar encompasses three components: engineering design, professional development, and personal development. Through the engineering design component, the mechanism for realizing the hallmark principle is achieved. An engineering need of a non-profit community partner is identified, becoming the design project for the next two years for each new freshman class. The students become engaged in a longterm relationship with the non-profit community partner. The project provides a platform for exercising technical engineering skills and practices. The relationship, the organization, the contact people, the served audience provide a human culture with which the students become entwined. Consequently, the client-focus attitude of business is fostered in the engineering and computer science students. Unlike typical engineering semester-long projects -or even year-long capstone projects, the incremental pace over two years allows students to mature in their understanding of themselves, of the project, and of the community they serve. Through the two years, the students use more and various types of interpersonal communications than in a semester-long project. Further, the students do not view the client and his/her needs as a convenience for their education. The students become invested in the goals of the non-profit since the project's understanding and conclusion become a shared focus between them. In the following paper, the techniques and steps used to identify projects, build relationships, and align the students with a community need are described. To illustrate these points, aspects of the SEECS program and its community projects are presented. Finally, an innovative model for a project-based, honors-option for academically-talented students in SEECS majors based upon the practices used in the SEECS program is proposed.";

The review highlights an innovative approach of requesting students of computer science to become active members of existing OS communities as part of their curriculum. The acquisition of a wide range of skills, increasing student motivation, support for contextual learning and student-centered courses as well as the availability of a wealth of data to inform and support decision-making by educators are the main advantages as identified by the SLR. Similarly, high barriers to entry in OS projects, difficulties related to student support, assessments, grouping of students and choice of an adequate OS project are the potential challenges. In this paper, the advantages and challenges of using OS in an existing framework of a course design and delivery have been discussed in detail. In particular, the potential impact of OS in computer science education curriculum has been explored from the perspective of education providers.";

dblp:bibtexType "Conferences";
bibo:abstract "New information and communication technologies may be useful for providing more in-depth knowledge to students in many ways, whether through online multimedia educational material, or through online debates with colleagues, teachers and other area professionals in a synchronous or asynchronous manner. This paper focuses on participation in online discussion in e-learning courses for promoting learning. Although an important theoretical aspect, an analysis of literature reveals there are few studies evaluating the personal and social aspects of online course users in a quantitative manner. This paper aims to introduce a method for diagnosing inclusion and digital proficiency and other personal aspects of the student through a case study comparing Information System, Public Relations and Engineering students at a public university in Brazil. Statistical analysis and analysis of variances (ANOVA) were used as the methodology for data analysis in order to understand existing relations between the components of the proposed method. The survey methodology was also used, in its online format, as a research instrument. The method is based on using online questionnaires that diagnose digital proficiency and time management, level of extroversion and social skills of the students. According to the sample studied, there is no strong correlation between digital proficiency and individual characteristics tied to the use of time, level of extroversion and social skills of students. The differences in course grades for some components are partly due to subject “Introduction to Economics” being offered to freshmen in Public Relations, whereas subject “Economics in Engineering” is offered in the final semesters of Engineering and Information Systems courses. Therefore, the difference could be more tied to the respondent's age than to the course. Information Systems students were observed to be older, with access to computers and Internet at the workplace, compared to the other students who access the Internet more often from home. This paper presents a pilot study aimed at conducting a diagnosis that permits proposing actions for information and communication technology to contribute towards student education. Three levels of digital inclusion are described as a scale to measure whether information technology increases personal performance and professional knowledge and skills. This study may be useful for other readers interested in themes related to education in engineering.";

A large number of universities are offering undergraduate Computer Science and Software degrees in Pakistan. It is an imperative for high school students to know convergences and divergences between both degree programs before securing admission. The trend of introducing undergraduate Software Engineering degree in universities is growing with the passage of time throughout the world. The key question for selection of Software Engineering degree is how to differentiate it from undergraduate Computer Science degree which has already much success and market share. Due to new emerging degree of Software Engineering in Pakistan, there is still confusion and debate about the distinction of Software Engineering and Computer Science roadmaps for undergraduate studies. This paper presents comparison of undergraduate Software Engineering degree with undergraduate Computer Science degree. The comparison will help academic institutions, parents, students and other stakeholders to analyze and evaluate both degree programs. We present our observations and suggestions to improve current practices regarding representation, management and improvement in Software Engineering and Computer Science domain of academia.";

bibo:abstract "Program comprehension takes up a significant amount of the average developer's work time. Most development tasks require broad understanding of the code base. Modern integrated development environments (IDEs) possess a basic program comprehension toolset, but the primary goal of such tools is supporting program development, not comprehension. Standalone or built-in code comprehension tools provide a wider function set. Such tools could be especially important for junior programmers who lack experience with understanding large foreign codebase. In this paper, we describe an experiment we conducted with the participation of a group of Computer Science MSc students. The participants were given a simple programming task to solve which required understanding the software they modified. The students used CodeCompass, an open-source comprehension framework. During the experiment we collected various data on the students' comprehension strate-gies. We compare the results to previous comprehension models, considering the amount of programming experience and feedback from students.";

dblp:publishedBy "IEEE";
dbo:rank "1575";
dblp:bibtexType "Journals";
bibo:abstract "In the realm of education, the timely identification of potential challenges, such as learning difficulties leading to dropout risks, and the facilitation of personalized learning, emphasizes the crucial importance of early grade prediction. This study seeks to connect predictive modeling with educational outcomes, particularly focusing on addressing these challenges in computer science higher education programs. To address these issues, nonlinear dynamic systems, notably Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), have demonstrated efficacy in unraveling the intricate relationships within student learning traces, surpassing the constraints of traditional time series methods. However, the challenge of vanishing gradient issues hampers RNNs, leading to a significant decrease in gradient values during weight matrix multiplication. To solve this challenge, we introduce an innovative loss function, the MSECosine loss function crafted by seamlessly combining two established loss functions: Mean Square Error (MSE) and LogCosh. In assessing the performance of this novel loss function, we employed two self-collected datasets comprising learning management system (LMS) and assessment records from a higher education computer science program. These datasets serve as the testing ground for four deep time series models: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), and CNN-LSTM. Employing 29 meticulously designed feature sets representing combination of demography, learning activities and assessment, LSTM emerges as the preeminent model which is consistent with our expectation that RNN is the best suited approach. Building on this groundwork, we solve the vanishing gradient issue and boost the LSTM model’s performance by integrating the proposed MSECosine loss function, resulting in an enhanced model termed eLSTM. Experimental results underscore the noteworthy achievements of the eLSTM model, emphasizing an accuracy of 0.6191% and a substantially reduced error rate of 0.1738. The proposed MSECosine loss function performance in addressing the vanishing gradient issue yields two times better than compared to standard loss functions. These outcomes surpass those of alternative approaches, highlighting the instrumental role of the MSECosine loss function in refining eLSTM for more accurate predictions in course grade prediction, as well as the feature set that captures early grade prediction.";

bibo:abstract "In this Research-to-Practice Full Paper, we report on CS Pathways, a middle school computer science (CS) curriculum developed as part of a researcher-practitioner partnership among two public universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA. The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students’ culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1]. The curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of Computer Science for All. This paper advocates for the need for culturally-responsive computing, describes how it is integrated into teachers’ instruction, and presents the CS Pathways curriculum design.";

bibo:abstract "This paper delves into the longstanding debate surrounding the efficacy of open-book versus closed-book examinations in the context of higher education, with a specific focus on courses within the domains of Information Science and Humanities. The choice between these two examination formats has significant pedagogical implications, as it shapes the learning experience, assesses the depth of understanding, and influences student outcomes. To elucidate the advantages and drawbacks of each approach, this study employs a mixed-methods research design, incorporating quantitative data from student performance metrics and qualitative insights from surveys and interviews. The authors examine these two phenomena in a hybrid learning environment, which has proven to be a resulting effective tool for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. They explore how the cognitive demands and assessment criteria differ between these two modes of examination, considering the distinctive nature of disciplines within Information Science and Humanities. In Information Science, open-book exams are often regarded as aligned with real-world scenarios, reflecting the accessibility of information resources in professional contexts in the post-COVID era. In contrast, closed-book exams emphasize memory recall and analytical reasoning skills. We investigate whether these distinctions translate into varied learning outcomes, student satisfaction, and long-term knowledge retention. Within the Humanities subjects, where critical thinking, analysis, and interpretation are paramount, the debate between open-book and closed-book exams gains further complexity. We examine how each format influences the development of critical thinking skills, the ability to synthesize and apply knowledge, and the cultivation of a deep understanding of complex texts and concepts. Additionally, this paper explores the role of technology and digital resources in shaping the dynamics of open-book exams, and whether this evolution in the accessibility of information has altered the outcomes in Information Science courses compared to Humanities courses. The findings from this study provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum designers, and administrators in Information Science and Humanities programs, helping them make informed decisions about the most appropriate examination format for their courses. By considering the unique characteristics of these disciplines, the research contributes to the ongoing conversation surrounding assessment methods in higher education and offers a nuanced perspective on the open-book versus closed-book examination dilemma.";

The study involved students enrolled in the Introduction to Programming (IP) course included in two slightly different Informatics Engineering degrees at the same institution. The motivation section of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) instrument includes several scales and subscales used to analyse different motivational factors.Four research questions guided the study. The first is comparing the results of the two groups of students. The second considered the student’s previous programming experience and tried correlating it with motivational factors. The third is similar but separates students following IP for the first time and those who had failed it in previous years. Finally, the fourth research question examined the influence of motivational factors on students’ learning performance measured by their final grades.This paper provides a detailed study description and presents and discusses its results.";

bibo:abstract "Despite their proven importance, team- and leadership competences tend to be highly underrepresented in Computer Science curricula. In order to support improving team performance in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) project teams, the rhea.framework of team leadership interaction has been developed by one of the authors. In this Research-to-Practice Full paper, the framework is briefly introduced and the students' experience with the rhea.framework in a student-centered Computer Science course at Master level is studied. We focus on the process of introducing the rhea.framework as an open educational resource and on students' experience of applying the framework for reflecting upon their team leadership interactions. Moreover, students were asked to evaluate the rhea.framework in light of their initial experience with it. While students suggested improvements on the rhea.framework, they appreciated the class on team leadership interaction. Consequently, the framework and scenario described in this paper is intended to encourage educators to include experiential learning into their courses and to research the effects. This can be done, for example, by reusing the rhea.framework and joining the authors in their endeavor to provide sustainable, significant learning on handling challenging interpersonal issues in ICT projects.";

Beginning in the 1970s, laser photonics emerged to spawn many important new applications, including enabling power-efficient, greatly expanded capacity and speed in transporting information. Over the ensuing decades, these applications have matured, fostering significant advances in information age technologies; not only for transporting information between people and systems, but also in routing and switching within computing and data storage systems. Today photonics research continues this trend, advancing the convergence of the two key 21st century information age technologies: communication and computing. This paper highlights some of the key semiconductor material science and molecular engineering advances that have contributed to these developments.";

The current research performs a longitudinal study that explores the use of LearnEval, a comprehensive peer assessment platform, in two computer science courses in two consecutive years. Both courses followed a Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach, allowing a peer assessment component to be easily integrated. In 2020-2021 academic year, 78 students participated in the process in a 3$^{rd}$ year Web Applications Design course. In the following year, a subset of the same students (54) participated in the activity in a 4$^{th}$ year Human-Computer Interaction course. A quantitative analysis of the outcomes in the two years was performed and the results were compared. Furthermore, the LearnEval usability was assessed. Therefore, the current work addresses two research questions: (1) How do the outcomes of the peer assessment activity in the 4$^{th}$ year course compare to the previous year when the students attended the process for the first time? (2) How did the students perceive LearnEval usability in the two years? The main findings show that the results were slightly improved in the second year of attending the peer assessment process in terms of involvement, reviewing skills, grades assigned and quality of the feedback provided.";

As developing researchers, it is essential that graduate students learn to write clearly and effectively so that their work is accessible to their peers and colleagues. An essential part of graduate school education should include the teaching of formal writing skills. In most graduate programs, students learn formal writing skills from two sources, their advisors or a writing class. We identify a third source: the graduate student peer group. In this paper, we describe how we leveraged the existing collaborative research dynamic among students in a graduate research lab and created a writing group, similar in spirit to the concept of a reading group. We describe the inspiration, implementation, and impact of a writing group in a real-world research lab. We show how the writing group started organically after a PhD student took a graduate writing class in the Computer Science Department and thereafter initiated the writing group in his research lab. We also describe how a writing group can be implemented in other research labs to improve the writing of graduate students worldwide.";

dblp:bibtexType "Conferences";
bibo:abstract "Parallel patterns, views, and spaces are promising abstractions to capture the programmer's intent as well as the contextual information that can be used by an underlying runtime to efficiently map software to parallel hardware. These abstractions can be valuable in cases where an algorithm must accommodate requirements of code and performance portability across hardware architectures and vendor programming models. Kokkos is a parallel programming model for host- and accelerator architectures that relies on these abstractions and targets these requirements. It consists of a pure C++ interface, a specification, and a programming library. The programming library exposes patterns and types and maps them to an underlying abstract machine model. The abstract machine model offers a generic view of parallel hardware. While Kokkos is gaining popularity in large-scale HPC applications at some DOE laboratories, we believe that the implemented concepts are of interest to a broader audience including academia as they may contribute to a generic, vendor, and architecture-independent education of parallel programming. In this work, we give an insight into the design considerations of this programming model and list important abstractions. Further, we document best practices obtained from giving virtual classes on Kokkos and give pointers to resources that the reader may consider valuable for a lecture on generic parallel programming for students with preexisting knowledge on this matter.";

This project was designed to enrich the integrative research experience of new-to-college students at LaGuardia Community College, and to engage them in hands-on inquiry and problem-solving practice, with a broader goal of increasing the retention rate in STEM majors by introducing students to the interdisciplinary nature of modern science and encouraging them to think of their future career paths in the same context. The major task in the project was to compare RNA sequences using computer programs, in order to facilitate the study of blood cancer. Throughout the project, students in both classes applied mathematical skills to perform algorithm analysis on a biological problem and were exposed to the application and basis of relevant technology in Computer Science. Collaborative work was conducted using ePortfolio as an online course platform which hosted all student work and allowed remote communication and collaboration to happen between two classes in different majors. Based on survey feedback, students were impressed by how they could contribute to the task using basic math and computer skills, and interest in continuing their STEM education was expressed unanimously.";

The research work was developed with students enrolled in Secondary Compulsory Education and High School, using a questionnaire as data colleting instrument. The analysis of the results shows that, in general, the situation is still worrisome. Female students show much less interest in careers related to computer science due mainly to the work of their teachers and a distorted perception of their abilities.";

bibo:abstract "Keeping up with new knowledge being produced in computing related domains is a difficult task given the pace of change in the field. Specifically, in domains that are undergoing a lot of innovation, such as Data Science or Artificial Intelligence, updating curricula is not easy. Yet, there is a need to be cognizant of new topics in order to create and update curricula and keep it relevant. In this paper we present an innovative approach to help educators keep a better track of changes in a domain and be able to map their curricula objectives to emerging topics and technologies. We leverage Q&A sites, Reddit and StackExchange, which provide a useful online platform for sharing of information and thereby generate a valuable corpus of knowledge. We use Data Science as a case study for our work and through a longitudinal analysis of these sites we identify popular topics and how they have changed over time. We believe innovations such as these are essential for improving computer science education and for bridging the workplace-school divide in teaching of newer topics. Our unique and innovative approach can be applied to other CS topics as well.";

In this research we look into the user's subjective feeling, the sense of security, called Anshin in the Japanese language. This paper reports our empirical study on a comparison between non-computer-science students in the US and Japan on their sense of security. We administered a questionnaire survey on the sense of security. Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we have identified four factors contributing to the sense of security both in Japan and in the U.S. We find that the students in the U.S. and Japan have two common factors, user interface and cognitive trust in the integrity and competence of the system and service providers.";

bibo:abstract "Full Paper. Research. We discuss possible ways to direct students to right level of introductory programming. While many schools offer college preparatory or advanced placement courses in computing, there is still, unfortunately, a large part of the \"college-ready\" population that has no opportunity to learn computing at all before they arrive. Regulation of CS education at the state/province or national level is still rare (but growing). Thus incoming students possess a wide range of skills and knowledge. When coupled with increasing enrollments, this diversity of experience can result in courses having large numbers of both absolute beginners and seasoned coders. Such courses are difficult to teach, intimidate novice students, and bore those with more experience. This can result in low engagement and retention.Unlike mathematics and language arts, introductory courses in CS vary widely from one institution to another in both conceptual material and programming language used. A standard point of entry to college mathematics is a calculus course, with some students instead starting earlier with pre-calculus or an algebra refresher, and others starting out in the second-term calculus course. There is rarely a concern about student skill being hidden by notational or other language differences, because the language of mathematics is close to universal. Similarly, freshman language arts courses in reading and/or writing assume a certain level of skill and maturity of comprehension and expressiveness in the target language; otherwise remedial courses are provided.We investigate placement of incoming first year students into appropriate introductory computer science courses at higher education institutions where there is more than one choice of first course. The goal is to determine the best way to decide which first course would be the most helpful for each student.";

bibo:abstract "This study identified the pedagogical and and ragogical learning orientations preferred by non-major Computer Science students in one of the higher education institutions in Malaysia. The pedagogical and and ragogical learning orientation model differs in six assumptions about learners, which are: the learner's need to know, self concept, existing experience, readiness to learn, orientation to learning, and motivation [1]. Questionnaires were developed and distributed among 262 undergraduate students in non-major Computer Science Faculty who took the Introduction to Programming Language course. Descriptive analyses have also been conducted (alpha - 0.958), and the results showed that a majority of the sample in this study (246 respondents or 93.9%) stay under Stage 2 in the four stages of learning development. This means that the respondents had a high preference for pedagogical as well as and ragogical learning orientations. Data collected shows that non-major Computer Science students in the age range of 18 to 24 are able to work independently since their self-concept had progressed to the self-directed learning phase. However, they still need guidance from their lecturers. These findings were used to develop a prototype of an individualized online learning environment based on the pedagogy and and ragogy as its foundational model. Learners in Stage 2 need goal-setting, learning strategies, and evaluation to be set by the teacher. The online learning environment allowed the student to explore her learning modules from easy to hard levels. However, students were allowed to continue to the next module even though their performance was not yet at the passing level. This is based on and ragogical theory, that they are dependent learners with a moderate level of self-directedness. Additional learning materials were also provided that could be freely explored by learners at their own pace. The prototype was tested among one group of 32 students in the Faculty of Education in the course Introduction to Programming using Pre-Experimental Research Design. The statistical analysis conducted indicated that the application of the pedagogical and and ragogical Model in web based instruction had a positive effect on learners' outcomes.";

bibo:abstract "Research Full Paper Most top universities in Brazil are public government institutions and tuition free. However, until recently, access to these institutions has been limited by extremely difficult entrance exams. The high standards at public universities are in contrast to the k-12 educational system, where public schools fail to prepare students for the exams, with only some of the private schools offering adequate preparation. In 2012, the Higher Education System in Brazil changed: the Quota Law was implemented for all 59 federal public government universities. This law reserves 50% of the enrollments for the public high-school students with the best grades in the entrance exams. Also, from this 50% allocation of places for students from the public high-school system, half are allocated to students from low-income families (up to one and a half times the minimum monthly salary), black and indigenous students. In this context, this paper addresses the research question: \"How does the intellectual sense of belonging and self-efficacy of the quota students compare to that the non-quota students' taking Introduction to Computer Science courses?\" We devised a questionnaire for students enrolled in the first programming course of different majors at a top-10 Brazilian university. This paper presents an analysis of the responses that indicates some differences in self-efficacy perceptions between the students admitted through the quota system and the ones admitted exclusively by their placement in entrance exams.";

bibo:abstract "This full paper reports on research into feedback perceptions. In recent years enrolment in Engineering Education went up and the number of international students increased, leading to larger classes and greater variety in prior education within the classroom. Literature review reveals large classes lead to fewer opportunities for students to interact with their teachers and receive high quality formative feedback. Feedback helps students to reflect on the quality of their work. Engineering Education is characterized by overloaded, heavily scaffolded curricula, and learning activities; it is paramount to provide students with feedback they perceive as useful and meaningful. The larger diversity in the classroom means there is a larger diversity in feedback perceptions that needs to be taken into account when providing feedback. In this work we present the preliminary outcomes of a study that was informed by the following research question: How do first-year bachelor students perceive feedback? We performed multiple semistructured interviews with 17 first-year students in computer science during their first semester, and aimed to collect data on the students' lived experiences and the spread of student realities, using a phenomenological approach. The preliminary results show that there are many essential aspects that influence students' feedback perceptions. Study shows that such aspects as large class and relationships with teacher play very important role in developing certain feedback perceptions amongst students.";

bibo:abstract "Ministry of Communication and Information, Indonesia has stated that Indonesia will become the largest digital economy player in Southeast Asia in 2020. This phenomenon can definitely trigger the digital players in Indonesia to choose online business as their career option. Therefore, there is a need to inculcate the entrepreneurial spirit of students, especially information systems and computer science students. This research work aims at analysing the Entrepreneurial Orientation by exploring its components in line with students majoring in information systems and computer science in Indonesia. It also examines the correlation between Entrepreneurial Orientation and students' preference towards entrepreneurship. Questionnaires have been distributed to the information systems and computer science students at 5 different universities in Indonesia. The hypotheses were developed after conducting the pilot testing. By using the cluster probabilistic random sampling, the 1.230 questionnaires have been distributed and this data collection process yielded back with 381 usable responses that were examined by utilizing SPSS and structural equation modelling. This study finally reveals that there are three dimensions under the Entrepreneurial Orientation variable that are risk-taking, innovativeness and proactiveness. Further, this study reveals that the EO dimensions are positively correlated with entrepreneurial intention among information systems and computer science students. This research is one of the first studies that try to exert and analyse the Entrepreneurial Orientation among information system and computer science students in Indonesia using AMOS-SEM software. Suggestion for future research are also proposed.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This study aimed to develop, test, and evaluate an educational kit for high schools that fosters a multidisciplinary bond between physics and computer science. Grounded in constructionism, the kit encourages students to take a more practical approach towards STEM subjects by using simple Arduino-based boards and sensors to measure physical quantities during simple experiments. The project was a collaborative effort between the University of Trento and Level Up, a local company that produces innovative educational materials related to physics and science for schools. The study involved 16 high schools with over 300 students and about 20 physics and informatics teachers. The kits were validated through questionnaires and interviews, with an emphasis on assessing changes in student motivation, interest in STEM subjects, and practical experience. Background: The learning-by-doing approach is central to constructionism, which emphasizes the importance of hands-on, experiential learning in education. This approach is often neglected in the Italian school system, which tends to prioritize theoretical studies that are distant from real-world problems and applications. Part of the problem is the lack of experimental sets available to each student. Intended outcomes: First, to create an educational kit that high school teachers could use to provide their students with practical experience in their physics curricula and enable them to apply their knowledge of computer science to arrive at better results. Second, to measure a change in students' interest in STEM subjects once they experience a more practical approach using the educational instrumentation created in the project. Another goal was to increase their motivation and engagement in the learning-by-doing process and to help them understand the importance of a multidisciplinary approach. Findings: The students who participated in the project were asked to complete two questionnaires regarding their approach and motivation towards STEM subjects, both before and after using the educational kit. The answers were divided by gender to determine if there were any differences in approach. The study recorded a very positive response from the students and a growing motivation towards this type of hands-on method used during classes.";

Research and development skills are primarily taught at institutions of higher education and have translated into numerous benefits for students, such as enhanced cognitive skills and a broader awareness of the discipline. This paper presented a model for running undergraduate research courses at the Computer Science Department, University of Guyana (UG). Key components of the model include preparatory assessments, two-semester offering of research courses (formal proposal and thesis), human resources, mechanisms for guidance and support, assessments and grading rubrics. The model was first implemented in 2017/2018, and was monitored and evaluated over a two-year period using a sample of 23 undergraduate students who were pursuing computer related BSc degree programs. Students provided feedback via a survey that was primarily focused on the research process, supervision, course structure, weekly research sessions, and general strengths and weaknesses of the undergraduate research model. The participants reported positive feedback such as having a good grasp of the research process, high levels of confidence in conducting independent research and preparedness for postgraduate studies. As such, this undergraduate research model may have wider applicability for the UG community and other institutions of higher learning.";

bibo:abstract "The increasing adoption of technology in the classroom offers several advantages, but also challenges all stakeholders, including instructors, students and decision makers. E-learning has gained momentum, especially in the last two years with the onset of the pandemic, forcing lectures to migrate to the internet and requiring new methodologies to support knowledge transfer between instructors and students. Thus, to verify the situation of Angola in relation to practices and methodologies related to the teaching of informatics, we search to identify existing practices through the application of a questionnaire to teachers of informatics subjects in secondary schools, colleges, and universities of the country. This study aims to discover the effects of using technology as a support for teaching computer science classes, including software engineering, programming, and computer networks. Therefore, 82 participants were involved in this study answering an online survey. Results shown that, although digital technologies are revolutionizing the world and consequently education, institutions in Angola still face several challenges, such as, lack of laboratories for practical classes, lack of electricity, lack of internet, and lack of computers for students. In addition, the adoption of technologies in the classroom proved ineffective, perhaps because of the absence of determining factors for technological inclusion by the institutions, or even because of the training of teachers in the area, whether weak, inefficient, or incomplete. In this sense, although the use of software in the classroom facilitates the acquisition of knowledge, there are still several barriers to be overcome for this to happen broadly. This study concludes that it is necessary to consider technology as a basic need for the facilitating role it plays in society.";

Similarly, completion of code-tracing assignments was positively, but weakly correlated with course grade; the grade of students who had completed at least a given number of assignments was one letter grade better than of those who had not, and the difference was statistically significant; and the mean course grade ranged from C- for those who had completed 6 or fewer assignments to B+ for those who had completed 11 or more assignments.

In this study, we aim to compare the Computer Science research in which Latin American scientists have participated, by analyzing the co-occurrence networks of keywords chosen for the corresponding scientific publications. To this aim, we collect information, from the Scopus website, about the scientific publications whose authors belong to one of the two best universities in eleven Latin American countries filtering scientific publications only in the area of Computer Science. Next, we build graphs per university, calculate some structural measures. Additionally, we define a metric named University Keyword Diversity (UKD) as a variation of the statistical equation of entropy for the keywords appearing in the university research articles. We correlate such metrics with the number of citations and the university ranking finding correlations as high as 0.8. Our results show that the university with the highest UKD in Latin America is Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and that its corresponding graph is one of the richest in number of nodes and relations.";

bibo:abstract "The process of developing, parameterizing, validating, and maintaining models occurs within a wide variety of tools, and requires significant time and resources. To maximize model utilization, models are often shared between various toolsets and experts. One common example is sharing aircraft engine models with airframers. The functionality of a given model may be utilized and shared with a secondary model, or multiple models may run collaboratively through co-simulation. There are many technical challenges associated with model sharing and cosimulation. For example, data communication between models and tools must be accurate and reliable, and the model usage must be well-documented and perspicuous for a user. This requires clear communication and understanding between computer scientists and engineers. Most often, models are developed by engineers, whereas the tools used to share the models are developed by computer scientists. Computer scientists often struggle with implementing methods for exchanging data between models while simultaneously maintaining the usability that engineers desire, and engineers often struggle with utilizing the tools that computer scientists have developed. In the process of developing tools and interfaces for model sharing and co-simulation, much is lost in the communication between computer scientists and engineers. This paper seeks to ease the communication barrier associated with model sharing and model co-simulation by clearly and simply discussing some of the commonly associated challenges and solutions, and then providing clear and concise implementation examples.";

In addition, we have included a face-to-face instance (“defense”) where each student must make modifications in their own code in a maximum established time. In a previous work, we conducted a survey to all students of Computer Science II, where it turned out that 24 % of 115 students expressed that “defenses” were perceived as “not useful for validating authorship”.

The prospects developed in the area of Project Based Learning Approach, Collaborative Learning and Embodied Programming are taken into account. Surrogate Embodiment, in the Embodied Programming context, is a kind of interaction where the movements performed by a person on a stage are directed by students. Furthermore, it is used as a structuring resource in the teaching process, the development of computational devices, paying special attention to skills development in the area of Computational Thinking. This paper presents a Video Game Development Workshop based on this approach with first year students from a state technical school. The experience has shown satisfactory results in connection to the acquisition of concepts and fundamental practices in the area of Algorithms and Programming.";

bibo:abstract "This full research paper explores how novice computer science and information technology students at two Swedish universities describe the subjects of computer science and programming. Computer science is a young, dynamic and multifaceted discipline and is currently undergoing a paradigm shift, mainly due to the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence and its connection to society and individuals. Computer science is becoming integrated into elementary school curricula and these aspects combined make it important to investigate how students perceive the subject. Reflective texts from 133 computer science and information technology students have been analysed using inductive content analysis and statistically significant differences among students have been investigated using Chi-Square analysis. The results show varying perceptions of the field, from quite basic and narrow views to more nuanced understandings that encompass its multidisciplinary nature and societal implications. Interestingly, female students were more inclined to consider the societal implications of computer science, suggesting potential avenues for enhancing educational strategies and fostering gender diversity within the field. The results in this study highlight the importance of continuous investigation into students' perceptions to guide educational approaches, promote inclusivity, and cultivate diverse perspectives within the ever-evolving discipline of computer science.";

bibo:abstract "With enrollment in computer science (CS) programs continuing to rise, effective student advising is increasingly important to improve student performance and retention. Yet many advising strategies focus on identifying struggling students based on GPA after the semester ends. By the end of the semester, it is too late to add or drop courses, and often too late for students to benefit from other resources which could have helped them succeed in the previous semester's courses. Identifying struggling students as early as possible could have a significant positive impact. If these students can be advised as early as possible, these students could be provided support and allowed to add or drop courses before it is too late. In the present work, we study the earliest student data in the semester, including the grades on the first homework assignments and first midterm exam. By leveraging actual student data, we develop predictive models of student success based on early homework and midterm scores. We have created models which predict with up to 86.7% accuracy whether a student will pass the data structures course, based on as little as the first homework assignment. These initial predictions could enable advisors to more rapidly and effectively support struggling students very early in the semester, improving a student's chances for success.";

bibo:abstract "Digital forensics has become a fundamental piece of many cyber security programs across the US, and data recovery is an integral building block of digital forensics. Data recovery can be a difficult topic to cover without a system or organization to the different methods of recovery. The following manuscript offers a structure for introducing data recovery in a digital forensics or information technology course and a method for evaluating the admissibility of recovered files as court evidence based on how the data were recovered. This offers both a framework for teaching data recovery and a way for discussing evidence admissibility. The five levels of destruction paradigm is a result of over a decade of teaching digital forensics in vocational and academic environments in a computer science program. The authors offer up this paradigm in hopes it will be useful to other computer science and digital forensics educators.";

The multidisciplinary crossing centered on computer science is gradually formed. Computer has unparalleled advantages in calculation, modeling, simulation and so on. It makes computer science hold a significant position in other disciplines. How to make students better understand computer knowledge, how to make them easier use computer to solve actual problems in their fields and how to break the barriers between disciplines are the challenges computer educators will face. This paper thought computational thinking is a good method and introduced its core concepts, discussed the dialectical relationship between computation and thinking, analyzed its important role in computer teaching of various disciplines. It indicated computation is a kind of thinking process which uses computing technology to process information and thinking refers to the activities of the human brain to perceive the world in which computation plays an important role. Finally, the paper proposed a modular teaching method based on practical case, engineering project and disciplinary characteristics for achieving the cultivation of computational thinking.";

bibo:abstract "This paper explores the attitudes of Computer Science (CS) teachers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) who are confronted by the Saudi Teaching Competencies Standards (STCS). The STCS is a response to a substantial need to develop both subject-specific pedagogical ability as well as teachers subject area knowledge. The Ministry of Education in the KSA is encouraging teachers to improve their practices to achieve the new quality requirements for education. This paper presents the results of an investigation of CS teachers' views on educational belief changes in the KSA schools. The paper addresses how and why CS teachers adopt new educational beliefs in their teaching. The paper presents the results of the investigation of the CS teachers views on educational belief changes in the KSA schools and the STCS policy document guidelines. Research in the area of changing educational epistemology in teaching CS identifies six factors that influence teachers, these are personal pedagogical beliefs, peer learning, curriculum, self-directed learning, student feedback and the STCS. A mixed method study approach was adopted in this work. Content analysis has been applied to the interview transcript and thematic coding analysis to the government policy document (STCS). The results provide a valuable case study in the KSA and emphasize the weak relationship between educational epistemology change and the STCS norms. The findings show that the STCS should provide stronger guidance for CS teachers to keep changing beliefs in teaching CS. The STCS should offer supporting official resources to CS teachers to help them in changing their beliefs in regard to teaching CS.";

bibo:abstract "Computer Science continues to experience underrepresentation of women at all levels. In recent years, much emphasis has been placed on attracting and retaining women to enter the discipline and, as a result, there has been an increase in the percentage of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees awarded to women. These gains are a critical step in achieving the ultimate goal of gender representation in computing that is reflective of society at large. This goal is not focused on the end of the educational pipeline, however, but on the industry as a whole. If women do not persist and thrive in academic and industrial careers, the positive impacts of diversity will not be realized in the most influential sectors of the discipline. Our research focuses on faculty in the assistant professor rank, specifically with respect to the research outputs of journal publication and conference presentation, which are highly influential in achieving promotion to associate professor and securing tenure. Our results indicate that research productivity of women is on par with that of men at this career stage. However, we find significant gender differences relative to factors that impact the overall experience during these years, most notably in the realm of parental responsibility. These results may provide insight into why women leave academic positions at a higher rate than men.";

But the amount of systematic research on CS gifted students' information ethics is insufficient. This study measured the information ethics level of CS gifted students and also analyzed various factors that influence information ethics. For this study, 30 CS gifted students were selected and their levels of information ethics, moral judgment and problem solving abilities with regards to computer science (CS problem solving) were measured, then their abilities to control their emotions were measured through a cognitive psychological method. The results of the analysis showed that there were no significant demographic component differences (gender and grade level), but moral judgment level and emotional control were the highest correlating variables for information ethics, with moral judgment being the most influential factor.";

bibo:abstract "Although we cannot be certain that science fiction directly influenced the course that computing technology has taken over the past 50 years (1950-2000), the genre has, at the very least, anticipated the technologies we are using and developing. Speculation about our future human relationship to computers, and to technology in general, has been the province of science fiction for at least a hundred years. But not all of that speculation has been as optimistic as those in the computing profession might assume. While cautionary tales in science fiction are plentiful and varied, the genre is also filled with more optimistic speculation about computer technology that will help save time, improve health, and generally benefit life as we know it. If we take a look at some of this speculation-both optimistic and pessimistic-as if it were prediction, it turns out that many science fiction authors have envisioned the future as accurately as historians have chronicled the past. Prediction is difficult, goes the joke, especially when it comes to the future. Yet science fiction authors have taken their self-imposed charters seriously; they've tested countless technologies in the virtual environments of their fiction.";

This paper describes efforts, through the National Science Foundation's Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships program, to increase the number of graduates, especially women and other under-represented groups, in these fields at The Community College of Baltimore County in Maryland. From fall 2001 through fall 2003, scholarship awards, generally of $3,125 per year, were made to 73 full-time students. Criteria included 2.5 Grade Point Average, and verified unmet financial need. The average awardee received the scholarship for two semesters. Half of these awards were made to women. Faculty mentoring, and a required one-week summer experience for academic support, career and transfer information, and field trips to local businesses and government agencies were used to increase retention and success. Success rates for awardees are compared with those at the college and in the state.";

bibo:abstract "This full innovative practice paper presents a study on the effectiveness of a computer science bridge program at a mid-sized regional public university in the Northeast United States. The program was designed for incoming first-year full-time students pursuing a degree in computer science (CS) at the university. The structure of this program differs from others with its leadership consisting of undergraduate students of varying seniority. It also features an emphasis on building a strong sense of community and seeks to inspire creativity in CS through lesson plans that are complementary with what participants learn in the university’s degree program.This study investigates the outcomes of the program after three iterations. To quantify its impact on participants, retention rates of program participants are compared with those of students who were invited to participate in the program but declined. Positive effects stemming from near-peer mentoring and the creation of a lasting digital support network for program participants are also analyzed.The researchers expected the data collected to reflect a successful impact from students’ participation in the program. Chi-square testing on the collected retention data from the first two cohorts revealed a statistically significant result for one cohort.The third iteration of the program resulted in a highly active online community of freshmen that has been supported by students of higher seniority throughout participants’ first academic school year.Based on these findings, we urge all institutions seeking to support a diverse body of students in their STEM pathways to implement summer bridge programs. We recommend engaging existing undergraduate students in developing and leading such programs, and focusing on building a community and on-going support network.";

bibo:abstract "In the graduate schools across the US, the teaching of graduate courses continues to constitute a significant component of graduate education. This paper presents a philosophy that underlies the design of a few advanced graduate courses at Arizona State University in the sub-disciplines of hardware description languages, communications networks, computer-aided design of digital systems, distributed systems, distributed algorithms, and modeling and simulation. From the philosophy, a new metric emerges-the extent and significance of the knowledge \"discovered\" by the students, towards evaluating the quality of such courses. Discovery refers to the knowledge that is brought out into the open, through logical reasoning from the first principles, by the student for himself/herself. It is significant in that it becomes an integral part of the individual who not only gains invaluable insight and confidence in the subject matter but can improvise, reason, and apply it to other areas in creative ways. The paper illustrates the application of the metric through a number of actual cases encountered during teaching at ASU. It also presents a list of the desirable attributes of the underlying educational environment to ensure success in the design and delivery of such courses.";

Guidance for novel content in these courses was drawn from the ACM/IEEE CS 2013 Curricula and from recent research on HPC education. As recommended by the curricula guidelines, topics in parallelism were incorporated into many required Computer Science courses. Therefore, an analysis of contact hours devoted to parallelism in required CS courses at Northwest is also included. Results, based upon student surveys from the Operating Systems (OS) course and course reviews, indicate student interest and success in students having learned key topics in parallelism. Particular emphasis was placed on incorporating parallel computing topics into the OS course.";

bibo:abstract "Gender equality, as well as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), in computer science (CS) is primarily limited to binary gender diversity. It is known that women are heavily underrepresented in CS, but substantial parts of the DEI issues are still unexplored. Intersectionality provides a more nuanced perspective of equality as it acknowledges exclusion and discrimination coming from overlapping layers of people’s identities, e.g. gender, ethnicity, dis/ability, nationality, socioeconomic status, age, religion, and sexuality, in combination. It is important to address systemic barriers, bias, and stereotypes in CS through the lenses of intersectionality. There is a growing literature on challenges of women and binary gender diversity in CS, but a limitation to many of these investigations is that they look at only one dimension of discrimination rather than the complexity of intersectional challenges. That is why the research objective of this study is to provide information on the relation of intersectionality and CS, using the Systematic Literature Review methodology. The results show that there is still scarce research explicitly connected to the concept of intersectionality in CS, but awareness is increasing. The SLR also reveals various challenges and success factors related to intersectionality, which call for further attention.";

bibo:abstract "Science communication forms the bridge between computer science researchers and their target audience. Researchers who can effectively draw attention to their research findings and communicate them comprehensibly not only help their target audience to actually learn something, but also benefit themselves from the increased visibility of their work and person. However, the necessary skills for good science communication must also be taught, and this has so far been neglected in the field of software engineering education. We therefore designed and implemented a science communication seminar for bachelor students of computer science curricula. Students take the position of a researcher who, shortly after publication, is faced with having to draw attention to the paper and effectively communicate the contents of the paper to one or more target audiences. Based on this scenario, each student develops a communication strategy for an already published software engineering research paper and tests the resulting ideas with the other seminar participants. We explain our design decisions for the seminar, and combine our experiences with responses to a participant survey into lessons learned. With this experience report, we intend to motivate and enable other lecturers to offer a similar seminar at their university. Collectively, university lecturers can prepare the next generation of computer science researchers to not only be experts in their field, but also to communicate research findings more effectively.";

In this paper, to improve the user experience learning the basics of coding robotic motion in a non-visual environment, we introduce a symbolic programming interface of assembling tokens based on artificial vision recognition that preserves the working space free of obstacles and simplifies the programming process by sliding tokens together on a flat board instead of requiring complex electromechanical connections between them. The computer vision system detects symbols and numbers based on a Boundary Object approach that extracts the main features of the captured images and assigns them to the closest class contained in a reference library. Detected symbols and numbers are identified as part of an ordered array and interpreted as commands with an argument, providing auditory assistance in the case of errors, before being executed in a real mobile robot for instant learning reinforcement. Tokens were ergonomically redesigned for children allowing a simple manipulation for easy assembling and providing tactile and visual information to allow easy recognition by users, their instructors, and the artificial vision system. Throughout the paper, we discuss the design criteria before presenting the final implementation and its first results.";

The firewall must be configured accordingly network access policy. Therefore, the students have to be trained to acquire skills not only to understand network access policy, but also to translate it into firewall native language. The use of a graphical representation (high level) to model the network access policy consist in a resource to facilitate understanding and to minimize defects on firewall native language. For that, we have proposed an extension to Security Policy Modeling Language (SPML), the SPML2, which aims to create a visual representation of the network access policy using graphical notation. Also, in this paper we present SP2Model, a web based tool to support SPML2 network accesses policy modeling and its translation into firewall native language. Using the SP2Model, the student can model the network access policy in a graphical notation and, then, can generate the set of rules in firewall native language. The use of SP2Model has facilitated the teaching-learning process, compared to traditional approaches. We evaluated SP2Model (and consequently the SPML extension) through an experiment following the GQM paradigm (Goal / Question / Metric) comparing the traditional approach and the use of SPML2 in operational security education. We performed two experimental sessions and we present the results, as well as a discussion about the tool, its use and the trade-off on using it.";

bibo:abstract "Discussion forums play a key role in most university courses today as a way to provide support for students outside classroom hours. However, with large class sizes and growing workloads for academics, monitoring often-large discussion forums is not an easy task. As a result, situations where students are distressed, questions are unanswered, or students require urgent support, may go unnoticed. Text classification and sentiment analysis techniques have become a popular approach to determine user attitudes, emotions and experiences within business and social science domains. Initial research has begun to explore the application of text classification to students' written text to investigate how students experience learning processes. In this paper, we build on this emerging field, and apply text classification to forum text to determine if we can correctly notify lecturers when a student is experiencing difficulties with their Computer Science studies. We implement a Naive Bayes Classifier and apply it to a Moodle forum data. Our results show the potential benefits of this approach and also highlight key avenues for future work.";

bibo:abstract "Software Engineering and Computer Science (CS) programs often contain several mathematical courses or courses with large mathematics components or dependencies. Study success in those subjects can be influenced by students’ attitudes towards mathematics and their perceptions about their own relation with mathematics. To gain insights into how the mathematics perceptions of computer science students affect their studies, we collected qualitative data from fourteen CS students from two universities in the context of an elective mathematics course. In this qualitative research, we used a triangulation strategy by collecting data from three different sources (interviews, questionnaires, and math-history assignments) to develop a comprehensive understanding of CS students’ mathematics perceptions. The thematic analysis revealed the factors that affect students’ perceptions about mathematics, including various types of prior experiences, their self-efficacy, math anxiety, and motivation sources. The analysis also highlighted that students find mathematics important for skill transfer to specific CS topics and for supporting continuous learning.";

Experiments were conducted to freshmen in the second course of algorithms and data structures. The strategy for the evaluation of the early education of parallel programming includes the use of OpenMP Application Programming Interface and sorting algorithms. The results indicate that students improved their skills by participating in parallel programing activities introduced at early stages or even at the very beginning of the undergraduate program. Freshmen could hit about 92%, 63% and 44% of easy, medium and hard questions after theoretical and practice activities. This represents an improvement about 19%, 14% and 39% for each respective difficulty level in comparison to the beginning of the study when all freshmen had no knowledge relative to parallel programming. These results aid to demystify parallel programming and to show that freshmen can learn it.";

bibo:abstract "Scientific competitions are held for more than a hundred years now and many paradigms have been experienced meantime depending on domain and pursued objectives. In Computer Science, most of the programming competitions are based on the time-to-complete paradigm for more than 30 years. Though this approach is undoubtedly successful for some contestants and some objectives, lately new paradigms have appeared that try to attract more students, to cover more areas of Computer Science, and provide for achieving more learning objectives. This paper presents an academic experience on an internal Computer Science competition, spanning on more than three decades, the focus being on its evolution and its continuous adaptation to the current learning needs, objectives, and contexts. Alongside with the motivation of changing the traditional paradigm, this paper describes in detail our new approach core ideas, our experience with it, while highlighting all the risen issues. After having had two editions already, we can provide some insights on its impact on team-based competitions, on its proved value for both promoting students' ideas and strengths and working on their weaknesses, whilst competing for both fun and success in a flexible way.";

Gamification applies gaming mechanisms to non-gaming platforms. Sadly, the use of gamification is still limited, especially in Malaysia. Gamification affects user experience, so it is intriguing to see if it can solve education problems. A study was conducted to identify elements of gamification. A systematic literature review (SLR) determines the gamification elements. Results show the list of identified 30 elements as guidelines for developing gamified teaching in Computer Science Courses.

bibo:abstract "This paper concerns new procedures devised to stimulate creative accomplishment by undergraduate students. The methods employed involve a wide range of educational technologies, and include flexibility for participant choices. Almost all students in the twelve offerings to date have been seniors in computer science. Thirty-five individuals completed team projects in one class. Typically from six to twenty students take this course. The course has objectives of furthering participant ability to communicate. Students gain experience with presentations, composing visuals, dealing with questions, participating in discussions, and in developing technical report writing skills. The author leads them to inquire and reach out by library, Internet, and personal interaction means. (Both with potential users of products they design, and authors of material they read on current computer technology). The methods discussed in the talk include ways to foster group interaction. Students are subtly encouraged to regard the class as an entity. This is done by the instructor adopting a 'guide on the side' stance, no grade being assigned to oral exposition, and giving only feedback-grades to written work prior to the submission of the team project. Some of the techniques used rely on electronic mail, complex use of the World Wide Web, availability in the university library of volumes compiled from professional and student work by the instructor, and multiple surveys of class participants. These means foster student cooperation and generate a sustainable noncompetitive dynamic. Forms and methods presented show what has been done over the past four years at UCLA.";

bibo:abstract "A Higher Education degree is composed by courses which can be organized in areas or modules. Over last years, time invested by students to complete Higher Education degrees has increased. This increment can be caused by the existence of bottlenecks in the courses of academic programs. We aim to carry out an analysis of students' performance to detect courses which represent bottlenecks in the process of completing a degree, because of many student failing compulsory courses. Students' performance can be stored in data sets. Unfortunately, analysis of large data set can lead to scalability problems not being comprehensive applying manual analysis methods because of its extension. We applied Process Mining techniques to overtake these scalability problems. Process Mining is a set of Sequence Analysis techniques to analyze event logs. In this paper, we conducted an analysis of a data set which includes the performance of 612 students applying Process Mining tools. We obtained frequencies of students according time invested to complete a course. We compared these frequencies to detect possible bottlenecks. Finally, some requirements to consider courses as bottlenecks are proposed.";

bibo:abstract "This paper is aimed at discussing several issues related to the teamwork generic competence, motivational profiles, and academic performance. In particular, we study the improvement of teamwork attitude, the predominant types of motivation in different contexts, and some correlations among these three components of the learning process. The above-mentioned aspects are of great importance. Currently, the professional profile of engineers has a strong teamwork component, and the motivational profile of students determines both their tendencies when they come to work as part of a team and their performance at work. Taking these issues into consideration, we suggest four hypotheses: (H1) students improve their teamwork capacity through specific training and by carrying out a set of activities integrated into an active learning process; (H2) students with higher mastery motivation have a better attitude toward teamwork; (H3) students with different types of motivations reach different levels of academic performance; and (H4) students show different motivation profiles in different circumstances, such as types of courses, teaching methodologies, and different times of the learning process. This study was carried out with Computer Science Engineering students from two Spanish universities. The first results point to an improvement in teamwork competence of students if they have previously received specific training in facets of that competence. Other results indicate that there is a correlation between the motivational profiles of students and their perception of teamwork competence. Finally, the results point to a clear relationship between some kind of motivation and academic performance. In particular, four kinds of motivation are analyzed, and students are classified into two groups according to them. After analyzing several marks obtained in compulsory courses, we perceive that the students who show higher motivation for avoiding failure obtain, in general, worse academic performance.";

These students used it both as a final course project or even only as project participants. Ultimately, we figured out that the platforms can be used as supporting artifacts for Problem-Based Learning in several disciplines. Their use could be restricted due to the space necessary.

Yet the usability of 'everyday things' is low (video recorders being a notorious example). It seems to follow that improvements must be sought in areas outside technology, such as human factors. But a premise is wrong: in fact, the technology, i.e., the embedded computer science, is appalling! Obsolescence, a symptom of Moore's Law, hides flawed design: poor products are replaced rather than fixed. The poor quality of the computer science of everyday things is eclipsed by the hope for fixing today's problems with tomorrow's consumption. The paper reviews Moore's Law and the usability of everyday things; it shows that professional computer science can improve usability with ease. Improvement will be essential when ethical and environmental issues become, as they will, unavoidable design criteria.";

bibo:abstract "Various data mining techniques, like prediction and clustering, can be applied on educational data in order to study the student's performance and behavior. Predicting academic results is one of the methods that aim at monitoring student progress and anticipating students that are at risk of failure in their academic career. In this paper, we propose a machine learning (ML) based Educational Data Mining (EDM) approach, named ARSITUN, for the identification of at-risk students. Using ARSITUN, an early intervention can be performed for the detected students in order to lower the risk of their failure. The proposed approach was developed and tested using student's data that were collected from the Tunisian administration system for bachelors and masters called «Salima». We created a new dataset, named GCSD, that concerns 358 students from the faculty of Sciences of Gafsa during the school years period 2014-2022. The experimental results showed that our EDM model reaches an accuracy of 90.44% for computer science bachelors’ grade prediction (Tunisian case study).";

bibo:abstract "This study seeks to investigate the effects of web-based computer programming learning, equipped with Questions and Answers, on students whose majors are not computer science. The proposed system allows five types of questions to be generated: essay, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, true-false, and coding. It is found that spending time to complete given tasks by interacting with questions is a significant predictor. Furthermore, academic performance is significantly correlated with participating in fill-in-the-blank, essay, and coding questions. Findings are also stated that there were no differences between academic performance and engagement regarding gender.";

Among the advantages of this process are the attraction of new adepts to the area, the capacity to awaken new vocations, and the ability to make the public more receptive and apt for new experiences. In this way, the use of comics as tools of popularization is very promising. Among the greatest qualities of this procedure of simplification of scientific concepts are the receptivity of the juvenile public and the ease of reading. This article aims to present the steps for the development of educational scenarios for comics about Computer Science, considering the experiences acquired by the authors in the production of plots for the educational comics allowed the identification of the best steps their elaboration. These steps were mapped in stages, aiming to assist the community in the production and elaboration of educational scenarios. These steps are aimed at helping the development of the plots in a mature way for any area of teaching, so it is possible to guarantee that, independently of the target audience or subject matter, the storyline can reach its goal in introducing knowledge to the reader.";

We discuss how we circumvented the usual challenges faced with PBL and some of the pragmatic issues faced during our implementation. Our experimental results showed that PBL did enhance students' learning in computer science concepts and their software usage skills. Furthermore, the classroom atmosphere was changed from the teacher-directed atmosphere into lively students-centered atmosphere in which students became active learners in and out of the classroom. We have also concluded that the blending of cooperative learning with PBL in a computer class is feasible";

bibo:abstract "This full research paper focuses on the design of a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the sharing of teaching practices (TPs) amongst computer science instructors. Many years of valuable TPs can be lost due to academic retirement when no competent knowledge management system is available for recording these TPs. Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users' experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features. The findings of this study hold considerable promise in relation to developing engaging and effective knowledge sharing systems for use by academic instructors.";

bibo:abstract "Success in doctoral education has been studied from many theoretical and practical perspectives, but very few studies focus specifically on student motivation. In practice, graduate schools usually try to evaluate applicants' motivation in the admission process, assuming they are able to identify the initial motivation that would predict a successful doctoral path. The aim of this study is to bring new understanding to this field by studying the relationship between the students' initial motivation in enrolling doctoral studies and their actual progress with the studies. This is a case study conducted in a Finnish research university with full-time doctoral students in computing. The research data includes interviews (n=30) and follow-up data of the participants' actual progress three years later. First, the participants were categorized according to their initial motivation for doctoral studies, based on the interview data. Second, they were divided into two groups based on their progress during the follow-up period. The participants who emphasized career goals as their main reason to apply for doctoral studies were more likely progress well with their studies than the students who emphasized intrinsic motivational factors. More generally, it seems to be extremely difficult to predict students' progress based on their initial motivation.";

Zadeh's task as Chair of the Electrical Engineering Department in Berkeley in the 1960s, his activities in Education of Engineering and his creation of the theory of Fuzzy sets generated his view on the scientific discipline of Computer science as a fuzzy set.

bibo:abstract "This research-to-practice full paper explores the effectiveness of coaching interventions with the goal of enhancing teamwork and project management skills among students in higher education. The paper reviews related studies on coaching practices aimed at developing students' professional skills as part of their higher education. It proceeds by investigating computer science students' perspectives on selected team coaching interventions. These build upon agile practices are targeted at facilitating and accelerating students becoming professional and productive - a ubiquitous need in the industry. To assess the efficacy of introducing team coaching in a project management course of the faculty of computer science at a large mid-European university, the researchers employed a method triangulation consisting of a pre-survey, focus groups, and retrospectives. The pre-survey assessed students' prior experience with teamwork, perception of project success factors, and interest in coaching interventions. Besides conducting a one-hour coaching workshop for all course participants, two out of eight student-teams expressed particular interest in participating in regular coaching sessions conducted remotely and in-person throughout the semester. The coaching sessions introduced students to various frameworks and approaches, including the Tuckman stages of team development, and focused on improving communication, organization, and task distribution within teams. Regular retrospectives allowed teams to reflect on their progress, identify areas for improvement, and implement action items for the next milestone. At the end of the semester, in-person retrospectives and focus groups illuminated students' experiences and preferences regarding coaching and teamwork. Results of the study indicate that optional team coaching interventions have the potential to improve students' team projects, application of agile practices, teamwork, and organizational competencies, given that students are open and willing to invest their time. Thus, this paper seeks to build a basis from which to spark curriculum designers, educators, educational researchers, and administrators to consider ways to include targeted team coaching interventions into undergraduate computing curricula.";

bibo:abstract "Service quality discussions in literature can be traced back to mid-20th century and have evolved from being service specific quality discussions to generic models of service quality to more advanced mathematical and statistical models. A bulk of this evolution has happened in the traditional business marketing world. With emergence of IT services, there is an increased interest to investigate the science behind these concepts. The paper is aimed to compress the evolution of these concepts into one article as a starting point for researchers from different domains to get a wider perspective on the area. In particular the review tries to highlight the challenges and problems in the existing approaches which can be potentially solved by advances in computer science. The connections have not been highlighted in the past since most known literature in service quality continues to point back to the traditional marketing world, giving primarily a marketing view. The intention is to facilitate engineers and computer science professionals to appreciate the marketing aspects of service quality, with an additional context from the IT domain, so as to fuel the research towards solving the problems in this area at the intersection of marketing, economics and science.";

bibo:abstract "According to the literature, Computer Science courses are highly technical but are lacking in soft skills that enable students to develop not only the technical skills but also professional skills such as collaboration, communication within and across cultures, teamwork and knowledge of diverse cultures. In this paper we report on the design and execution of a prototype framework for using active learning to build soft skills and diversity awareness into a service learning component for a database management course. In this course students were given an opportunity to work with a regional Native American organization to create a database solution for a maple syrup operation that needed greater coordination for marketing, distributing and delivering their product across ancestral homelands disrupted by colonialism. Our aim was to test the prototype framework to see if it increased student learning over the traditional final exam and brought greater self-awareness, recognition and respect concerning cultural difference. Students reported that they learned more about the technical aspects of database creation from doing the service learning project than from preparing for the final exam; they also reported greater awareness of cultural diversity. This paper lays out the design of our service learning pedagogy, the test results, and the model we propose for other computer science technical courses.";

bibo:abstract "Especially at the beginning of university studies, students form a group that is heterogeneous in many aspects. Compared with other disciplines, there is a significant dropout in computer science. We ascribe this to the fact that first-semester students often have significant deficits in cognitive competences - such as systematic and logical thinking - which are crucial for studying computer science successfully. To capture the students' learning capabilities, we developed a diagnostic test containing tasks that aim at evaluating the incoming students' initial level of highly relevant cognitive competences. In this paper, we evaluate the quality of this diagnostic test from a statistical point of view. Particular emphasis is placed on the analysis of the methodical competence. We assume that this component of the students' cognitive competences is of particular importance, as it is relevant not only for a successful start into the study phase, but is also essential for acquiring new skills and technical competences in computer science.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This study evaluates the generalizability of previously identified perceptions among engineering students of assessments in introductory programming (CS1). The students’ perceptions of their instructors’ and teaching assistants’ (TAs) roles in these assessments are also studied, and differences based on prior programming experience, gender, and course explored. Background: Basic programming skills are desirable also for students who are not majoring in computer science (CS). Students’ experience of assessments has not been fully explored. Research Questions: 1) How do engineering students experience the assessment (lab assignments, midterm exam, and project) in their CS1 courses? 2) What are the students’ perceptions of the TAs and instructors in relation to these assessment situations? 3) What significant differences can be found based on students’ prior experience in programming, gender, and course? Methodology: Previously identified themes from an interview study worked as a framework for the formulation of 25 statements used in a survey among 137 students in six CS1 courses (second part of a mixed-method study). Descriptive statistics, Mann–Whitney U Test, and Kruskal–Wallis tests with Bonferroni corrections, were used to analyze the data. Findings: Laboratory assignments were experienced as an opportunity to learn while the exams were viewed as predictable. The projects were perceived as authentic, although varying in difficulty, and as a huge leap from the lab assignments. Students perceived the instructors to put their touch on the course but viewed their TAs as carrying out the assessments, and experienced variations between TAs. Female students experienced these variations to a larger extent and perceived received feedback as less useful.";

bibo:abstract "Despite many initiatives to increase participation in K-12 computer science (CS), only about half of the public high schools offer CS, and only about a third of the K-8 public schools offer CS. To make matters worse, even if schools offer CS, interests wane from late elementary through post-secondary education. The lack of participation has been attributed to feelings of not belonging, technology-rich programs creating divides among students, and negative belief systems that CS is socially isolating, lacks creativity or fun, and is for intelligent, white males, and we believe one contributing factor is the way CS is introduced, taught, and scaffolded. In this full paper, we present innovative pedagogical approaches to teach fundamental CS concepts, such as abstraction, representation, algorithms, and computation, to 6th grade students using manipulatives, which are physical objects that students interact with to teach or reinforce a concept. Teaching and learning using manipulatives has a long history in science and mathematics education, but the development of and research on manipulatives to teach CS concepts is less common. Through observational field notes from a 6th-grade classroom and interviews with the teacher, we discuss the affordances and drawbacks of the different approaches and manipulatives. We found that using manipulatives led to increased student engagement and participation with the material and made teaching the material more exciting and engaging for the teacher. In addition, we found that the manipulatives provided a way for student misunderstandings and errors to be more apparent through tinkering with the physical objects, and the teacher was able to easily understand how to extend the activities and find ways to connect multiple CS concepts. However, we observed several drawbacks with different manipulatives and approaches for using the manipulatives that could be helpful for future changes and the development of new manipulatives. For example, the puzzle-like games we gave students to construct algorithms for tossing a coin to see who goes first in a game and playing Rock, Paper, Scissors were challenging for students to recreate a given algorithm that was not necessarily an algorithm they would have designed themselves.";

So, teaching creativity is an important endeavor in computer science education. This work highlights the importance of verbal creativity, providing empirical evidence that when students engage in other students' ideas, new knowledge emerge and is deepen. In this work we performed two case studies. In the first one were considered three computer graphics classes. Patterns of productive discourse that describe knowledge advancement have been found when students engaged in other students' ideas, criticizing, comparing, evaluating, selecting ideas, considering different alternatives, and pointing positive and negative outcomes. The second case study was run in six human-computer interaction classes. The online discourse was analyzed by means of the following categories: relevance, importance, novelty, bringing outside knowledge to bear a problem, ambiguities, linking ideas and interpretation, justification, critical assessment, and practical utility. The results show that when students are better in categories critical assessment, and linking ideas and interpretation, they are also better in category novelty and also the products generated are better. When they engaged in others' ideas they elaborated better interface designs.";

We take a case-study approach with three fourth grade teachers: one had a high number of students with special needs, one had substantially more gifted and talented students, and one taught a dual immersion English-Spanish class. Data sources include teacher interviews, design meetings between researchers and teachers, and classroom observations. We find that teachers with different pedagogical visions adopted the tools for reinforcement, student engagement, and formative assessment. We document teachers' iterative improvement strategies and shifts in teacher noticing, particularly the objects (i.e., computer science vocabulary and concepts), level (i.e., whole-class versus individual students), and depth of how they noticed students learning through video reflections. This study contributes to the ongoing work that examines instructional approaches to promoting computing education in diverse K-12 classrooms, especially among teachers with no formal training in computer science education.";

All six components are equally important and should be provided to form a coherent teaching and learning environment. A heat exchanger experiment was constructed to provide the specific test stand to illustrate the use of the environment. It is noted, however, that this environment could be used in almost any experimental situation. Two different educational experiences with the experimental environment are described. In both experiences, the students were provided with an excellent illustration of how a computer can be used for control of the experiment, data collection, data reduction, and analysis of the data to illustrate the underlying phenomena being investigated.<>";

bibo:abstract "In the dynamic aspect of banking, the ability to bank financial models accurately is paramount for strategic decision-making, risk management, and regulatory compliance. A robust financial model serves as a cornerstone for understanding the complexities of banking operations, assessing profitability, and optimizing resource allocation. However, despite the extensive research in this field, there remains a notable gap in the literature regarding certain aspects of banking financial models, especially the utilization of computer science in the field. Therefore, this paper proposes a taxonomy of the banking financial model in computer science studies. We utilized a taxonomy approach introduced by Nickerson et al. [1] with the conceptual-to-empirical (C2E) technique to construct our taxonomy for organizing and categorizing computer science fields into hierarchical groups based on shared similar objects and characteristics. Based on the result, our taxonomy advised structuring and describing banking financial models through five objects, thirteen dimensions, and 127 characteristics in which the risk assessment algorithm, data encryption, optimization algorithm, and Monte Carlo simulation are dimensions discussed more often. Furthermore, the empirical examination allows researchers to identify the utilization of integrating an optimal decision support system with uncertainty handling and software architecture in this research domain as a potential future work.";

bibo:abstract "Since the public launch of ChatGPT on November 20, 2022, there has been significant interest in its role in education. While some analyses focus on its potential to support student learning, a parallel line of investigation examines its potential to facilitate the false demonstration of competency on assessments. A broader underlying question is whether certain skills remain valuable to teach in the age of artificial intelligence, particularly in developing a new generation of computer programmers who continue to employ critical problem-solving skills in their work. The work presented in this paper examines the impact of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT-4, on a college-level introductory computing course offered simultaneously as a massive open online course (MOOC) on the edX platform. The study focuses on the strengths and limitations of LLMs in solving coding assignments while also aiming to identify problems that are resistant to LLM solutions, so these types of specific categories could be employed by other instructors in their MOOC courses to provide a better experience for students. The paper explores GPT’s proficiency in various areas, including pseudo-code interpretation, handling multiple correct answers, and addressing complex problem statements. The goal is to create a robust framework that discourages over-reliance on AI assistance from some students while preserving the scalability of the course. This research provides insights into the dynamics of AI in education and emphasizes the need for a balanced approach between technological assistance and genuine student participation.";

bibo:abstract "The common universal marketplace is contributing to the rapid globalization of higher education and those institutions offering internationalized undergraduate courses stand better chances of producing globally well-prepared graduates. The Engineering School (ISEC) of the Polytechnic Institute in Coimbra overcomes the physical boundaries of countries by offering transnational education programs such as the Bachelor degree European Computer Science Course and Master degrees (Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Sustainable Transportation and Electrical Power Systems) and by working closely with partner institutions. Knowledge of languages is obviously vital in any transnational program since it mirrors this international reality, which entails contact with different languages and cultures. Furthermore, future graduates will become participants in the resulting fusion of diverse cultures and languages and should therefore be prepared to deal with this reality. This study involves the language subjects pertaining to the European Computer Science Course undergraduate degree at ISEC. This work focuses on the use of translation techniques in the language classroom so as to help students not only to improve language skills, but also to get them to notice the similarities and contrasts between the different languages and respective cultures. The languages discussed in this research paper are English and German. The research begins with background information about translation, its history and application in language teaching. It then proceeds to demonstrate how the intervention of the mother tongue in the classroom is taking a turning point in a more constructive direction. Following, this study will consider some of the justifiable, as well as unjustifiable drawbacks of translation in language teaching. These will be considered together with the model exercises provided in part IV of this study. Lastly, and subsequent to this discussion, the study attempts to provide an idea of the use of translation in the language classroom and its benefits in any transnational course.";

To enable conference attendees to take full advantage of the potential for mentoring at these events, we have developed CONNECT (Creating Open Networks aNd Expanding Connections with Technology), a technology-based system that helps conference attendees meet and exchange information. This paper reports the results of deploying the CONNECT system at the GHC conference on two different years. Although the results were generally positive, with about 75% of the survey respondents indicating they were either satisfied or very satisfied with the support provided by CONNECT, there were also a number of suggestions for improvement. We review these results and provide a list of guidelines for creating an effective tool to encourage conference attendees, especially college students, to network and form communities.";

bibo:abstract "Problem. This full research paper describes the results of a literature review of data collected about K-12 computer science education research and initiatives. Over the last ten years, K-12 computer science (CS) education research has evolved to meet the needs and progress of the computer science education community. As a field, however, we have no empirical evidence of what this evolution is and how it has managed to produce the empirical evidence needed to support the long-term goals of computing education research as computing education grows into every primary and secondary classroom. Research Question. Our question for this study was How has K-12 CS education research evolved over the last decade, including when examining the research based on standards and inclusion of student participants? Methodology. Using a publicly available database of curated articles documenting K-12 computing education research efforts, queries were run to extract pre-specified subsets of data. Descriptive statistics were calculated to identify trends to support answers to the research question. Findings. We consider how this data reflects on changes in the last decade in light of the CS for All initiatives, including the fact that less than 5% of studies include students with disabilities and less than 20% of studies report participants' socioeconomic status. With the growth of computing in schools in the last decade, it is important to consider previous computing experience of students when analyzing results, but our data shows that only 40% of studies do. Implications. The good news is that this increase means that more topics, contexts, and student subgroups can be explored each year, and new insights on best practices are likely to arise from these findings. The bad news is that the attention to the needs of historically marginalized groups is not increasing at the same pace. While our data shows modest to gradual increases in the percent of research articles that report on factors such as the student race and instructor gender, these factors are still rarely reported, which may make it more difficult to ensure that CS education research involves a wide diversity of participants.";

The idea of inhibitory mechanisms actively weakening representations in the human mind has inspired a great number of studies in various research domains. In contrast, Computer Science only recently has begun to consider concepts such as digital forgetting or suppression of irrelevant information to complement activation and highlighting of relevant information. Here, we review psychological research on inhibition in memory and link the gained insights with the current efforts and opportunities in Computer Science of incorporating inhibitory principles for reducing information overload and improving information retrieval in Personal Information Management. Four common aspects guide this review in both domains: (i) the purpose of inhibition to increase processing efficiency; (ii) its relation to activation; (iii) its links to contexts; (iv) its temporariness. In summary, the principle of suppressing information has been used by Computer Science for enhancing software in some ways already. Yet, we consider how novel methods for reducing information overload can be inspired by a more systematic involvement of the inhibition concept.";

bibo:abstract "This innovative practice full paper describes the effectiveness of self-hosted large language models (LLMs) in assisting with the automatic grading of CSI assignments. Educators often rely on automated review of student code submissions in larger courses. Despite recent advancements, current systems primarily focus on assessing functionality, with important aspects such as code structure, efficiency, and style often relegated to secondary foci. LLMs provide an increasingly attractive addition to these systems to enhance those overlooked areas. Prior research has shown LLM's capable of assisting students in understanding and resolving programmer error messages, correcting syntax errors, providing enhanced explanations of code segments, or even generating code. The absence of freely available, purpose-designed LLMs for grading and providing feedback on code submissions prevents widespread adoption by educators. Remotely-hosted systems, such as fine-tuned GPT models, have shown promise, yet the associated risks of privacy breaches, ethical considerations, and recurring costs make this approach unfeasible as a universal solution. To mitigate these concerns, self-hosted open-source models are an alternative that can operate on consumer-grade hardware and prevent some privacy and security concerns. While no purpose-built solution yet exists, it is unclear if any existing models are powerful enough to facilitate automated grading. To explore these questions, we present a two-phase analysis, leveraging real grading data from a semester length, introductory CSI course with 124 students and nine programming projects. Nine stable LLM models were selected and repeatedly prompted to grade student submissions using the same context that a human teaching assistant (TA) was given. This paper analyzes 1,172,383 API requests, totaling 33.4 days of active runtime, evaluating model consistency, ability to adhere to specified constraints, and comparison to human-generated grades. The results show various models' inability to consistently grade assignments, albeit with some exceptions. The importance of providing comprehensive context to models was highlighted, as incomplete contexts resulted in worse performance. Other models struggled with longer prompts, delivering less consistent results. Despite disparities between AI-generated and human-assigned grades, the potential for refinement is clear; improved rubrics or selective fine-tuning could enhance model output. Future work will focus on analyzing models' qualitative justifications for grades, refining rubrics, training on domain-specific datasets, and fine-tuning the highest performing models to potentially improve grading accuracy.";

Review ratings by authors have potential to improve the quality of peer reviews, by giving way to remuneration of good reviews. A significant problem, however, is that authors' perception is hardly neutral, but might be affected by the reviews. To gain insight into their perception of peer reviews, we have conducted a survey among the authors of papers submitted to a peer-reviewed computer science conference. One of our findings is that authors are satisfied with reviews whose comments they deem helpful, and when they feel that the reviewer has made an effort to understand the paper. Suprisingly, these results hold when controlled for the score given by the reviewer. Based on the study results, we discuss the suitability of author ratings to identify high-quality reviews. We describe a remuneration function for reviews based on author ratings that aims to neutralize the effects of review scores.";

bibo:abstract "This research-to-practice paper introduces a mini-course module designed to teach computer science students how to interact more efficiently with Generative AI(GAI). The rapid rise of GAI is transforming education by providing students with easy access to knowledge and answers to their questions, acting as a personal tutor. Particularly in the field of computer science, where GAI can easily generate code based on specific requirements, many instructors struggle to prevent students from using tools like ChatGPT for completing assigned programming assignments and homeworks. However, we argue that 1) the use of GAI is inevitable, necessitating a redesign of courses so that students cannot merely rely on GAI without actual learning; and 2) students' learning can be enhanced if they learn to use GAI more effectively. In this paper, we demonstrate how we integrate Project-Based Learning to design the course module in a concise yet effective manner, which not only facilitates students' learning of GAI but also enriches their learning in relation to the host course where this mini-course module is embedded. In particular, the goal of this module is to teach CS students: 1) the basic principles and workflow of GAI; 2) Prompt Engineering: how to craft questions to interact more effectively with GAI; and 3) Extending GAI: how to create interactive tools by training customized GAI models. Designed to be completed within two weeks, the mini-course module can easily be incorporated into host courses. This mini-course module was integrated into a graduate-level Artificial Intelligence course with 42 students in Winter 2024. To assess the module's impact on student learning and engagement, we conducted pre- and post-course surveys as well as student interviews. The results from the surveys and interviews highlighted key areas for improving the design of educational modules to better teach essential GAI skills. These insights focused on enhancing student engagement and learning efficiency within a concise time frame.";

bibo:abstract "This research paper examines the experience of Computer Science students during their period of study in higher education institutions, based on the surrounding ecological system, using Bronfenbrenner's theory of human development as a guiding principle. The objective of the study was to uncover the significant elements of the student experience when the student environment is regarded and categorised as an ecology. We focused on eight distinct student development lifestyle categories that could have an influence on their experience: the student's own awareness of their experience as a concept, their pre-university phase, their transition to the university phase, their university peers and colleagues, their social background outside the university, their hosting department, their extracurricular activities, and their post-university phase, if any. The study involved the participation of 206 computer science students, yielding a suitable population for analysis. The survey contained 42 questions to address the aspects of the eight categories discussed above, with a range of questions for each category. The questions employed a mixed-methods methodology using open-ended and closed questions. For the open-ended questions, we followed a grounded theory coding analysis technique to identify common codes in the student's responses. Word fre-quencies and figures were also analyzed to gain insights into students' perspectives using sentiment analysis techniques. For the quantitative questions, response rates and summary statistics were calculated. The findings shed light on the pivotal factors that influence the student experience of Computer Science students, offering valuable insights to students, educators, administrators, and decision-makers. The study highlights the significance of environmental factors in shaping student experience in the CS discipline and proposes potential directions for future research in this field. The implications of these findings for the creation of more supportive and effective learning environments for Computer Science students are also discussed.";

dblp:bibtexType "Journals";
bibo:abstract "Computer science (CS) plays a crucial role in addressing challenges across various sectors, including education, finance, and healthcare. Investigating scholars’ topic switching behavior quantitatively is essential for understanding the driving forces behind technological development in CS. However, the continuous growth of scientific publications poses challenges in accurately tracking scholars’ topic switching. To address this, this study utilizes a large-scale dataset from the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph (MAKG) to construct bibliographic coupling networks for 16,794 scholars, enabling the detection of their research topics using the Louvain algorithm. Subsequently, this study introduces a novel two-dimensional metric to quantify scholars’ topic switching behavior: topic switching degree and topic switching probability. This metric enables the classification of scholars into four distinct types: Type A, Type B, Type C, and Type D. Our analysis reveals that the majority of scholars belong to Type B, characterized by high topic switching probability but low degree, correlating with the highest quantity, quality, and citations of publications. Scholars categorized as Type A and Type D follow, while those falling under Type C, indicating low topic switching probability but high degree, tend to have the lowest publications and citations. Employing these new two-dimensional indicators to measure scholars’ topic switching behavior and exploring its relationship with research performance contribute to advancements in technology within the field of computer science.";

bibo:abstract "Basic and applied research have been a pair of popular yet vaguely-defined concepts in scientific philosophy and technology management. This classification gets further challenged as once-theoretical studies like Artificial Intelligence became applicational in less than a decade. As such, a quantitative approach to evaluate the ongoing changes in and around computer science domain has both theoretical and practical implications. This study applies Topic-Aware Level Score, a science-of-science measure of application to mathematics and computer science domains and draws the following findings: On the theory side, methodological theories like graph algorithms and mathematical modeling are gaining application colors, but core and fundamental theories like equations and linear algebra remain steady as pure theories. On the application side, the most applied studies identified in this research have all been moving towards application in the past 3 decades, but some at a much faster pace than others. The study also identified neural networks as a representative case where the given study was completely theoretical in the 1990s but are now among the studies with highest application levels, making them potential showcases for technology incubation. This analysis of basic and applied research helps policymakers and research administrators to determine research directions and formulate funding strategies effectively.";

Concurrent with this thinking, women were deemed to be naturally deficient in math and hence their large-scale absence from math-related disciplines. Lacking empirical support for nature-based arguments, current research relies on social determinism to test gender-based disparities in the pursuit of math. Although this latter model seems closer to reality, as evidenced by research results, this paper suggests that future studies must examine the issue from a choice-based paradigm. With work roles no longer based on gender, questions regarding women in math disciplines must be examined within choice-based models rather than those that emphasize environmentally determined criteria. We propose an integrated research model that includes choice as a critical causal variable.";

bibo:abstract "Background: This research paper focuses on syn-thesizing state-level data sources on Computer Science (CS) education by creating algorithmic processes to aggregate the various data sources available. The expanding landscape of CS education (CSE), particularly at the high school level, has wit-nessed significant growth in participation in CS courses. However, to effectively prepare students for careers in engineering and computing fields, it is imperative to ensure the presence of highly qualified teachers to educate and guide them from the foundational level. Utilizing the C.A.P.E. theoretical framework, our research introduces a methodology to understand the CSE landscape through the lens of the teacher capacity model in WI public high schools. Research Question: This research outlines a case study of Wis-consin (WI) public high schools, primarily focusing on utilizing the C.A.P.E. framework to answer: What methodological process should be considered to measure equity-focused capacity, access, and participation of the CSE landscape for WI public high schools? Methodology: We obtained data from the WI Department of Public Instruction (DPI), encompassing course enrollment, student demographics, teacher certification, and staff reports. The data spans Academic Years (AY) 2017 through 2023. For consistent data reporting, our analysis focuses on 503 public high schools in WI, supplemented by data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This integration of data sources can offer valuable insights into the CSE landscape at the state level. Findings: Access to certified CS teachers positively coincides with higher participation in CS courses across diverse racial and ethnic groups of the WI public high school student population. However, our analysis reveals a critical shortage of CS teachers, with nearly 40 % of certified teachers in public high schools having over 25 years of teaching experience, suggesting an impending wave of retirements within the next 5–10 years. Contribution: Our objective is to provide a case study of WI public high schools by integrating noisy and unlinked data sources to understand the algorithmic process we followed to grasp the meaning of the CSE landscape. This analysis can help guide stakeholders and policymakers in allocating resources to alleviate inequities and shortfalls in the current CSE landscape, aiming to secure increased funding and expanded opportunities for CSE.";

dblp:publishedBy "IEEE";

dblp:bibtexType "Journals";
bibo:abstract "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been employed significantly in different domains of computing education. Nevertheless, these models have been focused on essential adherence to their integration as coding assistants in computing education. However, attention has been switched to thoroughly examining and analyzing LLM behavior, particularly in computing education for programming tasks such as code generation, code explanation, and programming error message explanation. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand their behavior to examine potential pitfalls. This article addresses this gap systematically and details how different LLM-based coding chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Codex, Copilot, and others, react to various coding inputs within computing education. To achieve this objective, we collected and analyzed articles from 2021 to 2024, and 72 studies were thoroughly examined. These objectives include investigating the existing limitations and challenges associated with utilizing these systems for coding tasks, assessing their responses to prompts containing coding syntax, examining the impact of their output on student learning, and evaluating their performance as debugging tools. The findings of this review highlight that it is premature to incorporate these systems into computing education due to their limitations that may limit their effectiveness as comprehensive coding assistants for computer science students. These limitations include issues with handling prompts containing code snippets, potential negative impacts on student learning, limited debugging capabilities, and other ineffectiveness. The finding also reports multiple research directions that can be considered in future research related to LLMs in computing education.";

bibo:abstract "This research-to-practice full paper presents our innovative approach to integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots into selected BSCS courses. These courses operate within an Online Learning Environment (OLE) based on asynchronous communication. We have detailed two distinct approaches to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model-based GAI chatbots. The first approach utilizes Microsoft Copilot Studio, allowing us to create customized chatbots without the need for coding. The second approach involves Python coding to develop more advanced GAI chatbots. Both methods are straightforward and cost-effective, leveraging the latest advancements to enhance communication between students and faculty. By incorporating frequently asked questions and answers from various BSCS courses into these chatbots, we can enrich the learning experience and aid both students and faculty in achieving their goals. Our preliminary results suggest that with careful planning, design, and implementation, these chatbots can circumvent common issues such as misinformation, inaccuracy, ethical and safety concerns, and lack of contextual understanding, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of student learning in an asynchronous communication-based OLE.";

bibo:abstract "Research in computing education has been steered towards understanding early indicators of what leads students to succeed in introductory programming courses (CS1). A major finding of these research efforts has been the impact that high school courses and prior programming experience have in predicting success in a post-secondary CS1. However, the socioeconomic status surrounding CS1 students has not been well explored as an indicator of performance. Specifically, a student's high school socioeconomic status (SES) has not been well investigated in this area, despite the intuition that more socioeconomically advantaged high schools will better prepare students for college computing courses. In this research, we propose a method to examine a student's prior high school regional socioeconomic status and determine whether this SES has a correlation to their post-secondary CS1 performance. This paper investigates the socioeconomic status of the neighborhood, census tract, and county the high school resides. To understand the socioeconomic statuses of these regions, we utilize multiple socioeconomic indices such as the Area Deprivation Index and the Social Deprivation Index. Some of the factors that create a deprivation index are the housing values of the region, poverty rate, adult educational completion, and household resources. After proposing a method to examine if there are any correlations between a student's attended high school regional SES and the student's performance in CS1, we perform a case study using seven years of CS1 student records from our institution. From the 4863 student records we use in this study, our initial findings indicate that students from more advantaged high school regions tend to pass CS1 more frequently across all surrounding region sizes we examined. Since our findings indicate that high school regional socioeconomic status may be a factor in a student's performance, we argue that future computing education researchers should consider a student's SES as a demographic factor of course performance in order to advocate for interventions that mitigate this disparity gap.";

However, the concern that continues to persist in a number of higher institutions of learning is the low graduation rates and poor performance in computer science programs. This study, carried out in a Kenyan public university attempted to extend the understanding on the performance of computer science students The study aimed at examining whether performance in early foundational core courses had any influence on the final graduation score (through final accumulative score) among computer science students using ensemble machine learning methods. The study specifically employed Random Forest and XGBoost ensemble methods. The results showed the Random forest regression model having a prediction power of 83.20% while XGBoost had a slightly improved prediction power of 84.6%. The results also revealed better model performance when using only years 1 and 2 core courses as compared to using years 1 to 3 core courses. This is an indicator that foundational core courses are good predictors of student academic performance in computer science programs. This work in progress is part of a preliminary study aimed at addressing the challenge of low graduation rates and poor performance in computer science programs.";

bibo:abstract "This research-to-practice WIP paper reports on a study that explores the comparison between two different exposures to microelectronics in engineering and computer science classrooms. Career choices for the semiconductor sectors are critical, as there is a current shortage of a trained workforce, with legislation such as the CHIPS Act supporting this need. Microelectronics have been introduced to the classrooms with the objective of more hands-on experience, using the best instructional practices. However, using microelectronics in the classroom may affect students' learning outcomes and their career choices. Therefore, in this paper we use Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), to understand how exposure to microelectronics, and self-efficacy in computing tasks affects the interest of students in learning more about microelectronics. We found that longer exposure to microelectronics was correlated with a lower interest with microelectronics, potentially explained by the experiences of students with longer projects and troubleshooting. In addition, we found that most students felt comfortable solving computational problems, and that prior experience with microelectronics did not correlate with higher interest.";

bibo:abstract "This paper presents a study which examines the pedagogical-interactional dimensions in computer science education at universities of applied sciences, focusing on the expectations and perceptions of students and professors. Data were collected using a modified version of the Learning Culture Inventory (LCI) questionnaire and analyzed both descriptively and inferentially.The descriptive statistics reveal differences in the mean values between the ideal and real states of educational conditions as perceived by students and professors. Inferential statistical analyses using t-tests identified significant differences between the perceptions of the two groups. The effect size Cohen’s d was also calculated to determine the strength of the existing difference. The analyses show that there are significant differences in many dimensions of the LCI between the perspectives of students and professors. These differences are often associated with high effect sizes. The results therefore indicate that the students' expectations and perceptions deviate (considerably) from the professors’ perspectives.";

bibo:abstract "This work presents a novel perspective towards generating automated multiple-choice questions (MCQs)-a task fundamentally different due to the highly dynamic nature of computer science education, which spans several sub-domains. Taking advantage of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), our model provides a versatile approach to addressing the need for diversity and context in relevant MCQ generation across proficiency levels, topic areas. Resulting MCQs inspire implementations within a variety of educational environments - from classrooms, to online courses, and finally exams - equipping teachers with an instrument that could be easily adapted based on the specific needs o students. The model is trained on a carefully constructed dataset that includes material from more than 20 subareas in computer science, consisting of materials such as textbooks, online encyclopedias and Q&A websites. Through rigorous evaluation using comprehensive performance metrics, including Question Relevance Score (QRS), Diversity Index (DI), and Difficulty Alignment Accuracy (DAA), we demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our framework in generating high-quality MCQs. Moreover, we address ethical considerations inherent in AI-driven educational assessment, ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in the MCQ generation process. The cGAN architecture facilitates the generation of contextually relevant MCQs across various proficiency levels and subject domains, enhancing the educational assessment process. The comprehensive dataset developed for this study encompasses diverse computer science topics curated from authoritative textbooks, online resources, question banks, and instructor-generated content. Additionally, a user-friendly QT application has been developed, enabling seamless integration of the cGAN model into educational environments. Through rigorous evaluation and ethical considerations, this framework demonstrates its efficacy, ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in MCQ generation. This interdisciplinary work represents a significant advancement in computer science education, providing educators with a powerful tool to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes.";

bibo:abstract "Problem solving plays a central role in computer science classes, whereby the problems to be analyzed are often already available in encoded form. The initial process where the learners have to parse information into symbols using adequate representations, has hardly been considered systematically so far. However, encoding development is essential for the understanding of sign processes and for general education. This paper therefore presents the development and evaluation of a teaching unit called “Cup Song Encoding” designed to model information encoding using a percussion song as an example. It simultaneously imparts coding theory concepts and fosters Computational Thinking of students. The material of the teaching unit is available online. The teaching unit was successfully tested with over 200 students in different age groups in K-12 during which the students' solutions were recorded and examined. The outcomes of the unit demonstrate the potential for encoding modeling to be a valuable addition to K-12 computer science education. The results also show how Computational Thinking methods can be integrated in computer science classes.";

bibo:abstract "This research paper focuses on evaluating code-generating chatbots. Chatbots like ChatGPT released in the past three years have proven capable of a wide variety of tasks within a conversational interaction, including writing code and answering code-related questions. With these recent advances, chatbots have many potential uses in education, including computer science education. However, before these chatbots are used in CS curricula, their capabilities and limitations must be systematically tested and understood. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities and limitations of four known, open-source, code-based chatbots in programming tasks by performing a standardized study in which different chatbots are tasked with providing answers for a variety of assignments from Boise State University's computer science program. We found that while all of the chatbots can write code and provide explanations, some do better than others, and each of them work differently in conversations. Moreover, all of them suffered similar and important limitations, which has implications for adoption in curriculum. As a second experiment, we used the Llama chatbot to perform a human evaluation by enabling student novice and experienced programmers to use it as a coding assistant to complete specific tasks in a common software development environment. We found that the coding assistant can help novice programmers accomplish simple tasks in comparable time and code efficacy as more experienced programmers. Given these experiments, and given feedback from participants in our studies, we see a clear picture emerge: new programmers should learn important concepts about programming without the help of code assistants so students can (1) demonstrate their understanding of important concepts and (2) have enough experience to assess code assistant output as useful or erroneous. Then, once intermediate skills are mastered (e.g., object oriented programming and data structures), it seems appropriate to introduce students systematically to coding assistants to help with specific assignments throughout the undergraduate computer science curriculum. We conclude by addressing ethical considerations for the use of code-based chatbots in computer science education and future directions of research.";

Recently, Computer Science (CS) has achieved tremendous success among all career fields driven by the strong competence in the market and the rapid changes in technology. Our goal is to develop an automated framework that provides efficient management, evaluation and improvement of the CS students education, as well as a profound establishment of a successful study tree for CS university programs. Such a challenging goal comprises major factors that should be inclusively considered. High school (HS) students are expected to join CS university programs with different educational backgrounds and learning capabilities. The strength of association among several performance-related factors including the academic performance of students in HS is evaluated to gain insights and infer indicators in CS programs. The automatic correlational analysis of the prerequisites for each course is also investigated to assess the program structure and dependencies among several CS courses. In this comprehensive study, all these factors are efficiently analyzed in order to investigate the valid causes of low and high performance of both CS university students and programs. Experimental results have concluded several major findings with validated associations that assure and prioritize the importance of evaluation and improvement of CS education.";

Data were collected from 480 respondents who were selected via a multi-stage random sampling technique. Data collection instrument incorporated a computation of Computer-based ICT Literacy Coefficient (CILC) for each respondent as a function of ability to use ICT in course delivery, test/examinations, data collection and analysis, online discussion/seminar, and publishing. The instrument was pre-tested using the test-retest technique, yielding a coefficient r = 0.92 thus confirming its reliability. Having about average C ILC, respondents generally exhibited disparity in ICT literacy level on the basis of specialization, age, institution ownership, and qualification. Gender, years of job experience, and place of graduation had no significant correlations with CILC. The major constraints were acute power shortage, unstable/inadequate internet access, and inadequate institutional support. Recommendations were proffered based on the findings.";

bibo:abstract "This innovative practice full paper presents an empirical study aimed at evaluating the potential of ChatGPT, an advanced AI-driven chatbot, as a supplementary educational tool in undergraduate Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) courses. The study, initiated in the summer of 2023, focused on assessing ChatGPT's capabilities in generating accurate and complete computer code, identifying and rectifying code defects (bugs), and its scalability in handling larger programs. To achieve this, we conducted a series of experiments with ChatGPT. In one experiment, we introduced bugs into small programs from introductory CSSE courses. ChatGPT was tasked with detecting these defects and providing recommendations for fixing them. We evaluated ChatGPT's effectiveness in bug detection, the quality of its recommendations, and the completeness of the proposed solutions. We sought answers to questions such as whether ChatGPT found all injected defects, provided appropriate recommendations, and delivered high-quality solutions based on criteria like code completeness, size, complexity, and readability. In another experiment, ChatGPT was asked to generate code for assignments from previous CSSE courses, including Intro to Computer Science and Programming in C++, Intro to Python Programming, and Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures using Java. We assessed the generated code's correctness and quality in comparison to student-written code. Similarly, in a third experiment, we evaluated ChatGPT's ability to generate larger programs using requirement specifications from an upper-division CSSE course on Agile Software Engineering. Analyzing both qualitative and quantitative data from these experiments during the summer, we determined that ChatGPT showed promise as an educational tool. Consequently, we developed a plan to integrate ChatGPT into select CSSE courses for the fall semester of 2023. Specifically, ChatGPT was integrated into two of our introductory CSSE courses enabling students to utilize it for debugging assignments and generating practice questions for exam preparation. In addition, we encouraged student teams in our EPICS (Engineering Projects In Community Service) course to utilize ChatGPT as a supplementary aid to help them find and learn any new programming languages or technologies needed for their projects. Anonymous surveys were conducted at the beginning and at the end of these courses to collect feedback from students regarding their experiences with ChatGPT. Initial responses indicated that students were generally familiar with ChatGPT and expressed curiosity about its potential utility, although some skepticism was present. However, by the semester's end, students demonstrated a positive shift in perceptions. They appreciated ChatGPT's assistance in rectifying code bugs, especially after-hours. Additionally, students valued ChatGPT for generating practice questions for exams, despite some inconsistencies in its responses. In our EPICS course, students felt ChatGPT was useful for learning new technologies, though opinions varied on its project management benefits. Lastly, the majority of students felt that ChatGPT helped them adjust to their work progress, showing its potential utility in keeping pace with ongoing projects. Based on student feedback, we propose integrating ChatGPT into future CSSE courses. Finally, as AI -based tools become more integral to academic settings, we believe that disseminating our experiences could potentially enhance engineering and computing education.";

Broad traditional values held in common by most indigenous peoples formed the backbone of the project. These values led to the formulation of several significant components of culturally sensitive programs which were enhanced by classroom practices adopted and distilled during more than two decades of teaching from middle school to the graduate level. Many of these coincided with and reinforced traditional American Indian values. In addition, practical lessons were learned while creating this new model of education. Our conclusion: the core of minority-centered education should be good teaching strategies applied to a specific population but applicable to and effective for all students.";

bibo:abstract "Full Paper - The field of Computer Science (CS) has been of little interest to women straight out of high school when considering undergraduate majors in Brazil. At the University of Brasília, a top-ten university in Brazil, female undergraduate students account for less than 15% of the students in the Department of Computer Science. According to Stout and Blaney, a sense of intellectual belonging is “the sense that one is believed to be a competent member of the community”. This perception may be especially challenging for members of underrepresented minority groups, such as female undergraduate students in CS majors. In this context, this paper addresses two research questions: i) “How does the intellectual sense of belonging of female students compare to the male students' in introduction to computer science courses?”; ii) Is it similar for female undergraduate students in both CS and non-CS majors?”. We devised a questionnaire for students in the introduction to computer science courses for different majors. We analyzed the responses and, in general, introductory programming courses are challenging for all students, however, female students feel worse about their computing competencies than male ones.";

This research shows how this approach can constitute a way of working in the context of training computer science lecturers. Our proposal is based on identifying techniques for the transit through the different stages from the didactics of the teaching media to the educational research. We developed a concrete set of actions to develop and research academic/productive skills and competencies in the context of solutions to problems of pedagogical practice. It goes through the identification of academic training objectives, problem analysis, strategy design, the conceptualisation of digital didactic media and constant verification of satisfaction levels, all under a multidisciplinary, collaborative and creative approach in tune with the current times.";

bibo:abstract "During times when remote or hybrid teaching is inevitable, many instructors record their class sessions for greater student accessibility. Recordings allow students to follow classes at their own pace, when it suits them, to watch class sessions they missed due to unexpected circumstances, review complex concepts, and fill in gaps in their lecture notes when studying for exams. At the same time, class recordings can result in waning attendance or student engagement. The objective of the empirical study presented in this paper is to determine which factors contribute to the acceptance of class recordings and how often they have been effectively consumed by information and computer science students of one higher education institution in Croatia. Reported findings uncovered that students are willing to learn course topics from class recordings because they have met students' expectations and can therefore serve as an equal replacement for in-class attendance.";

The average of women who graduated in CS is lower in 2016 than it was in 1998 and the tendency is to continue to diminish, although the situation is very different from some groups of countries to others. We have made statistical analysis that has allowed to present a country classification. This analysis has shown that there is a wide difference between countries such as Mexico, Italy and Belgium for example. We have also carried out statistical analysis of possible relations between economic and social variables for the countries studied along the almost 19 years’ span and have found no statistically significant correlation in global terms, which shows that the problem is complex and that the solutions adopted are only partial.";

Mixed approach was used to study this population. First, qualitative data were collected by way of offline interviews of four focus groups. Based on the results of these interviews, and to collect quantitative data, an online questionnaire of forty questions was designed and distributed among the University students online; 106 of the University students responded, each of those also qualified as gifted based on their self-identification as Olympiads participants or winners. The results of both qualitative and quantitative data analysis revealed the importance of appealing to interest and challenge in the learning process of gifted IT students, as well as the need for greater independence and flexibility in the choice of material they focus on; these conclusions imply such students are likely to prefer educational experiences that are similar to the process of preparation to the said Olympiads.";

dblp:bibtexType "Conferences";
bibo:abstract "This innovative practice full paper describes a new software framework based on JU nit to test student work. Automated testing is an important capability when teaching software development at the college level. Ideally, a testing system will allow the instructor to efficiently create a thorough set of tests. Also, the software should facilitate grading tasks and produce informative reports that can be distributed to the students in a timely fashion. For Java development, the well-known JUnit framework enables a test suite to be applied to a student's submission. The mutools library presented here extends the JUnit framework in novel ways to accelerate the instructor's task of creating test suites. This new framework allows the instructor to augment tests with directives to control scoring and reporting. The four main capabilities of the software include: 1) An assert statement that does not terminate the test when it has failed. Instead, statistics are maintained regarding the success or failure of each assert statement. 2) Tests that can be configured to award partial credit. This can be useful in situations where the instructor deems it appropriate to award students some credit even in the presence of incorrect asserts. 3) Tests that can be grouped into categories that match a particular rubric item. Java annotations are placed on the test suite to define these categories. For example, @TestCategory(name= “remove”, points=10.0) specifies that 10 points will be awarded for successful implementation of all tests related to removing an item from the collection class. 4) Testing reports that contain varying levels of information. With minimal details, the testing report shows each testing category with the following information: assert statistics, whether the test timed out or had abnormal termination. This software has been used for many semesters and has been found to increase the speed at which the instructor can develop test suites for grading. The framework is available on github.";

bibo:abstract "Background: Students in technical communication classes need to develop expert-like competence in project schedule management to prepare for academic and career success. We address two aspects of project schedule management—estimating time and estimating the number of drafts—that affect undergraduate computer science students in linked computer science–technical communication courses as they prepare documents for their client-based team project. Literature review: Our research considers three areas (developing expert-like behaviors, estimating time, and estimating the number of drafts) that students need to address in their coursework with complex, client-based problems. Research question: What percentage of students accurately estimate, overestimate, or underestimate the time needed to complete project tasks in face-to-face and hybrid sections? We define accurately estimating time as an expert-like behavior and categorize both generating documents and estimating the number of drafts as project tasks. Research methodology: To discuss this research question, we introduce the participants, explain our informed consent, describe our survey instrument for collecting data, and detail our research design. Results/discussion: We present student estimations in two categories: estimated versus actual time to complete assignments and the number of estimated versus actual drafts completed. We learn that students misjudge the amount of time and the number of drafts needed to complete a project, suggesting that technical communication coursework can better prepare students in developing these competencies.";

It is no surprise that computer science might have something valuable to lend to the world of decentralized stablecoin design, as it is a “computing” problem. In this paper, we examine the possibility of a decentralized and capital-efficient stablecoin using smart contracts that algorithmically trade to maintain stability. By exploiting traditional abstractions from computer science, we show that a capital-efficient algorithmic stablecoin cannot be provably stable. Additionally, we provide a formal exposition of the workings of Central Bank Digital Currencies, connecting this framing to the space of possible stablecoin designs. We then discuss several outstanding conjectures from both academics and practitioners and finally highlight the regulatory similarities between money-market funds and working stablecoins. Our work builds upon the current and growing interplay between the realms of engineering and financial services, and it also demonstrates how ways of thinking as a computer scientist can aid practitioners. We believe this research is vital for understanding and developing the future of financial technology.";

The REACH platform is designed to support a large spectrum of computer science courses, from the equivalence of computer science lab 101, interdisciplinary projects, all the way to research projects in artificial intelligence, pervasive computing, and human computer interactions.";

bibo:abstract "In this article, I argue for the importance of using specific kinds of concept maps, such as ladders, in a technical writing class offered for computer science majors. This article presents a strong argument that use of concept maps should be effectively integrated both during planning stages and as part of traditional document production techniques. Assignments and activities in a technical writing classroom should address the use of concept maps for conceptualizing, schematizing and presenting procedural information like software documentation, explaining laboratory reports etc. Using concept maps efficiently can lead to structural and functional conceptualization, visualization, representation and retention of complex information. A survey-based study reported in this article suggests that advanced students in an EFL technical thesis writing course in this computer science institute has enough expertise to understand the use and application of specialized concept maps for technical document production activities. Results indicate that students, on most part, understand specialized document-specific, task-specific applications and especially specific sentences in the domain of computer science and self-reports also indicate that they are reasonably confident about their ability to apply ladders in logical ways.";

bibo:abstract "WIP Research Paper: Identifying the Threshold Concepts within a discipline illuminates the key concepts or components within the curriculum. Once students have overcome the barrier of learning these concepts, they often will be better able to identify as members of that community, and understanding a threshold concept opens the door to learning additional concepts. Within computer science, there has been much debate over what concepts could potentially be threshold concepts. Meyer and Land originally defined threshold concepts as resulting in an individual being placed into a state of uncertainty or liminality, and successfully traversing this liminal state results in a transformation of the individual with potential feelings of accomplishment. While there has been some work attempting to identify threshold concepts within the first year or beginning stages of programming, little work has considered the intermediate years (years 2 and 3) of university study and what potential threshold concepts exist during this time period. Our goal with this work is to help address this gap that exists by answering the following research question: What do intermediate students identify as being troublesome and/or ‘uncomfortable to learn’ within their computer science coursework?” A first cohort of participants were interviewed in late 2022 and coding began in the first quarter of 2023. The coding of these interviews proved challenging. The students who were interviewed often did not give enough information about a concept for the coders to identify whether the concepts had the key characteristics of threshold concepts. It was considered and accepted that the original interview protocol was not supporting the participants well in eliciting the types of information needed to identify a concept as threshold. The interview protocol was redesigned, and new interviews commenced. The work presented here is a continued discussion of the initial findings and the subsequent change in interview protocol, with the primary improvement being an inclusion of concept mapping. Concept maps, or a graphical representation of the interrelationship of topics and ideas, coupled with an intentional simplification of associated terminology, are expected to reduce cognitive load as participants reflect on their learning experiences. Interviews with the revised protocol including concept maps have been more engaging and productive in identifying potential threshold concepts within the intermediate computer science curricula.";

bibo:abstract "It is critical that we understand the systemic issues that have led to the historic marginalization of students in K-12 computer science education (CSEd) to the degree that we can design equity-centered policy and actions. Investments in CSEd have expanded rapidly through local interventions and state policy, however the data required to understand the impact of this expansion continues to lag or be insufficient. This paper takes a retrospective look at efforts to measure broadening participation in computing (BPC) approaches and identifies equity-explicit strategies moving forward, Over the last two decades, efforts to measure BPC have evolved from ad-hoc grassroots methods to more systematic and sustainable approaches. BPC, often interpreted as access and participation, does not address the inherent inequality embedded in the K-12 American public education system. Current data efforts often focus on the student, obscuring the systems and practices that contribute to inequities in CSEd. This paper concludes with recommendations for prioritizing data utilization and the development of holistic data systems that are woven into strategic plans that lead to systems change and equitable student access, participation and experiences in computing.";

bibo:abstract "Teachers face challenges in teaching new subjects at the early primary level. The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly.";

Our iterative scale development process consisted of: 1. Selecting questions from existing CS survey instruments; 2. Administering the survey at three different institutions; 3. Conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on the survey items; and 4. Updating the items based on the analysis results. Although a few of the scales are still a work in progress, after two iterative rounds with three surveys (N = 184, N = 338, N = 450), we established fourteen robust factors that can be adopted in future studies. The factors measure students' attitude toward CS, intention to continue their CS trajectory, three factors regarding students' beliefs about computer scientists, computing identity, current experience, proactive and preemptive help-seeking, familiarity with future opportunities, persistence, leadership, confidence, and perception of social support. Further, we demonstrate that these scales can be used to uncover differences between different groups of students (e.g., men and women, Black and non-Black students).";

Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies present a promising solution, enabling streamlined, efficient, and nuanced analysis of classroom observation data. This study aims to develop AI-based computer vision and multi-modal models to measure computer science (CS) instructional processes in video data and validate their accuracy. Using two K-8 CS classroom instruction videos, we tested two deep-learning approaches: 1) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for analyzing visual imagery, and 2) a multimodal deep learning approach that analyzed both visual and auditory information. Results showed that the multimodal approach achieved the highest accuracy. Our findings support the broader application of these methods for analyzing more intricate teaching and learning processes.

This ambiguity is foundational to computer science and has its roots in the response of university computer centers to the commercialization of computing in the mid-1950s. University computing experts developed an understanding of the activity of computing disentangled from the computer itself, a conceptual shift that went together with a parallel process of dematerialization of the notion of computer. These transformations were facilitated by the ascendance of a high modernist agenda in the sciences in the United States. University computing experts embraced the high modernist agenda and developed analogies across programs, notations, and a notion of the computer now understood as a model of computation. This immaterial conflation of notations, programs, and representations of the machine, would become one of the core tenets of computer science.";

bibo:abstract "The Computer Science Final Project is often a challenging requirement for graduation in Argentina. This leads to delays and people leaving. In the present work, an approach has proven efficient in recovering students who had left or extended their careers by getting the final work started and developed sustainably. The multidisciplinary approach is based on collaboration among tutors from different disciplines within the Faculty of Engineering. They work together to develop research projects and software for external institutions. Furthermore, the framework of a traditional course provides an organizational structure that facilitates both the generation of the proposal and the planning, execution, and completion of these projects within a reasonable timeframe. This paper presents the survey's results to validate the effectiveness from the students' perspective, conclusions, and next steps.";

bibo:abstract "This paper tends to present how eLearning strategies and policies used, in a Portuguese district (Aveiro), are enhancing learning and knowledge for heterogeneous audiences with constraints that are beyond the usual. Besides time to learn and physical distance, they face new challenges like, the need to get specialized in areas where economy is growing; where companies need to adapt to new markets; where the technology revolution is a priority. Experience achieved tells the professionals observed have shown great interest in eLearning actions and for a hybrid methodology. By a simple empirical evaluation, professionals agree that information and communication technologies (ICT) are, in fact, very helpful for those who have several constraints to learn. The use of Learning Management Systems (LMS) tends to accomplish the learning assessments and skills, although there are a lot of improvements that can be done through ICT, especially to promote self-study. The paper presents experiences done with a new learning application that enables a more intelligent and friendly content organization and promotes actor's participation powering efficient learning.";

bibo:abstract "Teachers often spend a long time assessing work and examinations for students; automatic short answer grading dramatically reduces any time spent grading. Also is can be tough for teachers to be entirely unbiased when assessing work. Towards addressing this, a short answer automatic grading agent utilizing answer segmentation for GCSE Computer Science with semantic matching was designed and implemented using a four stage pipeline. The short answer marking agent has over a 96% accuracy rating and marks over 55% of student answers with the rest being referred for human grading. The human graded answers are then used to further automatically improve the system. In the future the agent could easily be extended to other subjects and used for staff training in a wide variety of areas or possibly even to form the basis for active tutoring systems.";

bibo:abstract "News of the decline of enrollment and degrees awarded in Computer Science and related domains have been around for quite a while. Different regions and countries of the World have seen changes in the enrollment trends in various educational domains over the past decade. The rise of the dot-com bubble and it's demise had affected the world economy and it caused repercussions in the other fields related to technology as well. Education has also faced pressures due to the changes in enrollment trends and changes in study preferences over the last few years. Especially, educational options in Computer Science and Information Technology have been facing some issues across the globe. In this study we look at the Computer Science and Information technology (CS/IT) study options in the United Arab Emirates - UAE. In this country, based on current enrollments, CS/IT is the 5th most popular field for study. We examined the nationally accredited degrees in CS/IT available in this country for students of all nationalities and found that there more Bachelor degrees as compared to Master degrees. In some cases there are no Master program options for students that have already completed a Bachelor in that specialization. Currently, in December 2010, the accredited Computer Studies / Information Technology options in non-federal educational institutions in UAE are: 9 Associate degrees, 25 Bachelor degrees and 10 Master degrees. There is only 1 PhD study option in CS/IT available in UAE and that too is in a federal university. We believe that our study will prove to be very useful for organizations that want to conduct a feasibility study or needs assessment analysis of the United Arab Emirates for offering new educational programs in the country especially related to the field of computing. Our study can be used to offer specializations at the masters level in the UAE community.";

Chile has implemented various affirmative action initiatives to attract women to computer science programs, but there is almost no research on women’s performance in these programs. To address this issue, we conducted a descriptive case study that analyzes grades obtained in all mandatory courses within a computer science program over a span of 12 years. The results reveal women have a slight significant better overall performance and that there are no significant differences in grades across most of the courses, with only three courses showing a slight advantage for women. This study intends to serve a dual purpose: guiding efforts to attract and promote women in computer science and providing the industry with valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of female candidates during the hiring process.";

bibo:abstract "The identification of struggling students in a scalable manner in large computer science courses continues to attract researchers' attention because of the high failure and dropout rates in such courses. In the last two decades, studies on this topic made significant progress in taking advantage of dynamic data sources and employing machine learning techniques to identify struggling students. However, the success of these studies was still limited due to reasons such as oversimplification and utilizing exclusive tools. These limitations make it difficult to replicate the findings of prior research on this topic. To address these issues and explore the extent to which we can replicate studies on this topic, this study replicated a recent study that explored identifying struggling students at the topic level using context-agnostic features. Our results demonstrate the potential of context-agnostic features in identifying struggling students with varied success rates. Our findings shed light on the robustness and feasibility of using machine learning techniques to identify struggling students in large computer science courses. Finally, our discussion provides useful guidance on future studies and replications on this topic.";

The scales evaluated here present an opportunity to investigate global and specific aspects of mentorship competency in postdoctoral engineering and computer science training and education. The global construct of mentorship measured may help assess overall mentor capabilities for postdoctoral mentorship and indicate general needs for mentorship training. Similarly, a global construct assessment from postdoctoral trainees provides an alternative perspective on issues postdocs experience with their mentors. At the same time, individual items may be better used to assess more specific aspects of mentorship capabilities and needs, such as communication or professional development. The mentorship competency assessments for supervisors (MCA-ECS.S) and postdoctoral trainees (MCA-ECS.P) provide mentors and educational institutions opportunities to assess mentor competencies as self-evaluation and mentee-evaluation to understand better the education and training needs of postdoctoral mentors and trainees beyond the structure of graduate education systems.";

bibo:abstract "This research-to-practice paper describes the analysis of the application of Project Based Learning (PjBL) using industry standard tools and practices (ISTP) in Computer Science / Software Engineering courses and investigates the students' engagement and learning effectiveness. PjBL is an instructional strategy that helps students to learn and acquire skills by solving real world problems. Industry standard tools (e.g., GitHub, Jenkins etc.) and industry standard practices (e.g., Agile method based practices) can be used to imitate the real-world software engineering activities in a PjBL classroom. Many scholars have studied the impact of PjBL on student performance, retention, motivation, and engagement. While existing studies make contributions, there exists a knowledge gap on the interplay between industry standard tools and practices (IST&P) and PjBL. Moreover, the effectiveness of IST&P in supporting students' performance, motivation and engagement in PjBL have not been well studied and are largely unknown. Consequently, instructors are hardly intentional about the integration of IST&P to PjBL, this makes it more difficult for students to learn how to use IST&P in PjBL leading them to graduate without being well prepared for the real-world software engineering industries. To fill this gap and contribute to knowledge, this paper investigates the effectiveness of IST&P in the learning effectiveness, and the engagement of the students in Software Engineering courses. We carried out an empirical study among 68 students in a mid-sized classroom of a small university in Northern Pennsylvania, United States. We collect data using the Reduced Instructional Materials Motivation (RIMMS) survey as one of our instruments to evaluate students' engagement, and the Topical Content Test (TCT) based on the revised Bloom's taxonomy to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the proposed PjBL process. Our results show that PjBL using IST&P has a significantly positive impact on students' engagement. It also significantly correlates with the learning effectiveness in project based SE courses. We also noticed that although this process leads students to perform highest in Analysis and Evaluation levels of Bloom's taxonomy, students with better performance in Application level performs better in the Create level.";

These are the timed condition/event systems (TCESs) (Kowalewski et al., 1997) and the timed automata (TAs) (Alur and Dill, 1994) formalisms. The state of the project is such that, because of the equivalence of TCESs and TAs we have shown in (Kowalewski et al., 1997) that it is possible to automatically analyze real-time systems modeled by TCESs with analysis tools developed for TAs.

bibo:abstract "Research Full paper - Computer Science (CS) education is increasingly becoming popular across the globe. With the increased popularity of CS and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) courses, the ability to measure the similarity/distance between units can aid the decision-making process of education providers during learning path recommendations, evaluating unit exemptions/advanced standings, etc. The ability to quantitatively measure the similarity of two units will assist decision-making processes which are otherwise likely to be tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, we explore how to quantitatively measure the similarity/distance between two CS/ICT units, in an Australian setting. In this study, we utilize data from multiple CS/ICT courses offered by two Australian education providers. The data is generated as a result of the Australian Computer Society's (ACS) course accreditation process during which each unit of a course is mapped into multiple knowledge areas. We measured the similarity between units in terms of their coverage of the knowledge areas using multiple distance measures. Our work is novel in examining a quantitative measure of unit similarity, by introducing a unified approach across education providers that follow the ACS course accreditation process.";

In the particular case of computer science, it allows developing computational thinking skills. It has been designed with ease of use in mind. This free tool is available through a web browser and does not need a complex installation or specific hardware requirements, allowing educational robotics to be introduced to a wide range of users by working on practical projects that will help them understand key concepts of robotics and programming. The effectiveness of RoblockLLy has been validated based on motivation, usability, and user experience criteria. The tool was validated with 212 secondary school students (12–16 years old). Specifically, motivation was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, usability with the System Usability Scale, and user experience with the User Experience Questionnaire. Generally speaking, the results demonstrate that students perceived RoblockLLy as a novel and interesting tool. The ratings for usability were predominantly positive, although a few students indicated a preference for expert assistance. The overall rating of the user experience was positive as well, yet notable differences in attitudes toward motivation and usability were observed between genders.";

bibo:abstract "Low vaccination rates, inferior-quality vaccines, limited testing, and a lack of funding forced many institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa into online-learning-only environments for two years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instructors scrambled to put classes online. Only in 2022 did some face-to-face classes resume. Unforeseeable and unprecedented circumstances forced university personnel to function with reduced budgets and without regard for the return to in-person classes. We taught, studied, and analyzed a cohort of third-year Sub-Saharan African students who spent their first two years of studies online. We describe the struggles they faced and what can be done to make up for their shortcomings and missed opportunities. We quantify the shortcomings through focus groups, an analysis of what parts of an accredited program would have fallen short, interviews, and through anecdotal evidence. Our findings can help those who suffered a similar fate. These observations can be applied to non-STEM disciplines.";

bibo:abstract "This is a Research Full Paper. While considering offering online Computer Science (CS) courses at non-online programs in response to student demand or program need, how to address the challenges in online teaching and whether the student performance in an online course is compromised are two critical questions. In the literature, we could not find clear answers to these questions, especially for CS courses studied in this research in settings like ours. Converting three upper-division CS courses (operating systems, computer networks, and computer and network security) online in 2020-21 provided us an opportunity to explore the instructional design for online courses, to identify the challenges in online teaching, and to develop the strategies addressing challenges. We use t-tests to compare the student performances in online vs. face-to-face (F2F) sections of each course because our sample sizes fit in the most appropriate range (20 to 40) of t-tests. Box-and-whisker plots are also used to graphically compare student performances. Anonymous student surveys consisting of Likert-scale questions are used to investigate student perceptions in online courses. The analysis of performance and survey data shows no statistically significant performance difference between the online and F2F sections of each course taught by the same instructor as well as generally positive or very positive student feedbacks on teaching and learning in three online CS courses. Focusing on three neutral research questions, our study does not aim to comprehensively compare online and F2F modes or find which mode is better. Regardless what our data analysis indicates, we planned to report it. We hope that our experience and findings may provide useful and evidence-based information to other non-online computing or engineering programs, especially the ones like ours, when they need to consider whether to offer online courses.";

bibo:abstract "Cognitive load (CL), defined as the mental effort required to process information, plays a pivotal role in user performance and experience in various domains, particularly within computer science (CS) and information systems (IS). As technology grows increasingly interactive, understanding and measuring CL is crucial for designing adaptive, user-centered systems. This study investigates trends in CL measurement techniques in CS and IS research from 2017 to 2024, focusing on emerging tools, methods, and their applications. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of CL’s role in CS and IS, the methods used to detect it, and how it is analyzed across different tasks and environments. The motivation behind this research stems from the growing need to optimize user experiences and system efficiency through better CL management. The findings highlight a shift toward multimodal CL measurement, integrating subjective, behavioral, performance-based, and physiological data, often analyzed with machine learning in domains like human-computer interaction, education, and immersive technologies. This research highlights the importance of accurate CL measurement and suggests future directions for enhancing adaptive system design through the integration of CL metrics. Building upon these findings, future research should focus on advancing CL measurement through survey item sequencing, multimodal data integration, and device-task comparisons, while also exploring the use of AI for robust CL detection. Future research should explore survey design, multimodal data integration, device-task comparisons, and AI-based CL detection. Building on these insights, this study proposes developing non-intrusive, adaptive e-learning interfaces to optimize user engagement and personalization within LMS environments.";

bibo:abstract "The rapid advancement of software solutions in the industry has brought significant ethical concerns, ranging from data privacy issues to algorithmic bias and cybersecurity threats. Addressing these concerns requires software developers who are technically proficient and ethically aware. To foster such ethical awareness, embedding ethical training within the computer science (CS) curriculum has emerged as a preferred approach. This study presents a methodology for integrating ethics topics into various CS units, informed by the IMPACTCS project’s guidelines and implemented through a structured algorithm. After an initial formative assessment to gauge students’ perceptions of responsible computing, the curriculum was adapted to include relevant ethical concepts. Following the instructional period, a summative assessment was conducted to evaluate changes in students’ understanding and attitudes towards ethical issues in computing. The results indicated a significant improvement in students’ ethical awareness and their ability to apply ethical principles to real-world scenarios. These findings underscore the effectiveness of incorporating ethics education into the CS curriculum and highlight the importance of preparing future software developers to navigate the ethical challenges in the tech industry. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance responsible computing education and promote ethical practices in software development.";

bibo:abstract "It is a well known fact, that computer science (CS) is one of the most stereotyped and clichéd (STEM-)disciplines. Computer scientists are generally perceived as being male, physically unappealing, boring, uptight loners working with machines instead of people all day long. Obviously, these often unjustified stereotypes are not compatible with many high school graduates’ – especially girls’ and (young) women’s – self-concepts. Presumably, this incongruity is co-responsible for the low number of CS students in western cultures. In order to counteract these biases and clichés to broaden participation in CS study programs, these stereotypes need to be documented first. While this is already the case for CS and computer scientists in general, analogous investigations that focus on CS education (CSE) and CS teacher students in particular are still missing in scientific literature. Since western countries share a huge demand on qualified CS teachers, equivalent investigations can generate useful derivations for CSE study program planners as well. Therefore, this paper presents an online based repertory grid survey on the stereotyping of teacher students of various study subjects like CS, Physical Education, History, or Politics among others. Results show, that of all teacher candidates, CSE students were by far most likely to be rated unappealing and male. Attributed characteristics mostly were negatively connotated. At one of the survey’s questions focussing on who the participant would most likely ”like” (swipe right) and ”dislike” (swipe left) on the popular casual-dating-app TinderTM, the prototypical CSE student was ”disliked” by almost every second participant.";

bibo:abstract "This full paper proposes an innovative framework for teaching computer science topics to undergraduate students in Computer Science and Teacher Training (CSTT) for k12 majors. A Computer Science major is required by k12 teachers in Computer Science. However, there has been a concern in Brazil over the lack of explicit pedagogical methods included in CSTT majors. In this context, our research question is: how to teach a CSTT major, so that knowledge of computer science is learned by learning how to teach it through the application of a learning theory? To address this research question, this paper presents the LLL framework, a practical approach in which undergraduate students design and plan computer science lessons using a learning theory approach with a focus on teaching computer science to schools. The acronym LLL comes from “Learn computer science and Learn how to teach computer science by applying a Learning theory”. The LLL framework was tested in two consecutive courses in a year-long study on the operating systems topic in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Brasilia (UnB). UnB was a pioneer, founding the first CSTT major for basic education in Brazil in 1997. The undergraduate students were asked to plan a lesson using this approach and teach the content to their peers, being assessed by the instructors and their peers. The findings showed that the LLL framework is effective for preparing future k12 teachers to teach this content to school students. By adopting the LLL framework, CSTT undergraduate students (teacher candidates) will be able to develop solid pedagogical skills and provide a more meaningful learning experience for k12 students. This methodology has the potential to improve the quality of computer science teaching in schools, contributing to the training of undergraduate students who will be more prepared and engaged in this field.";

bibo:abstract "This qualitative research paper presents findings from an interpretive case study of five undergraduate Hispanic computer science (CS) students in a pilot leadership course in the CS department of a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). The course design drew on the relational model of leadership, a model that focuses on ethics and professional skills development and enhancing students' readiness to meet the demands of an ever changing global and diverse technological world. These students applied their skill set at a national conference for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) faculty and students. Data were collected from interviews with these five leadership students who participated as panelists in a faculty professional development workshop. Themes that emerged from the data analysis included students' views of leadership, self, and self with others. The students considered their participation in both the leadership course and the conference as critical in shaping their leadership identities. Moreover, the study demonstrates how the leadership course supported students in enhancing their leadership meaning-making from a relational perspective while at the same time fostering the development of strong Latinx CS identities. These findings support the need for responsive curricula and learning opportunities that promote the development and practice of professional skills to prepare undergraduate CS students, those who are Latinx, to meet workforce and societal demands.";

bibo:abstract "This paper introduces and identifies the preliminary findings from a study that uses backward design to explore how transfer works for technical and professional writing and computer science students in advanced writing-intensive courses. Analyzing course texts, such as syllabi and assignments, as well as faculty interviews and student focus groups, we identify and summarize several key topic areas regarding the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that students develop in their writing in the disciplines course and employ (with varying degrees of awareness) to be successful in their senior-level writing-intensive courses. The initial results suggest that the junior-level writing in the discipline course acts as kind of “introduction to WID” even though it is not designated as such. Moreover, taking this course prior to their senior seminar and capstone experiences enables students to become familiar with the disciplinary genres, conventions, and expectations and prepares them to identify what they do not know when faced with new writing situations. Lastly, the advanced courses’ focus on ethics and interacting with professionals in the field seems to encourage a problem-solving disposition in students, giving them the skills to know where to turn to fill in gaps in their knowledge and the confidence to trust their evaluation of the sources they find.";

bibo:abstract "This research WIP paper presents findings from an interpretive case study of computer science (CS) students in a leadership course at a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI). The course incorporated a curriculum centered on building students' critical consciousness so that students were empowered to recognize and challenge structural barriers related to race and gender disparities in CS education and the workforce. Such awareness is imperative for actively engaging in the transformative process necessary for effecting meaningful change. Furthermore, fostering students' critical consciousness stands as a key endeavor, particularly within disciplines such as computer science, given the profound societal ramifications inherent to this field. Data were collected from surveys, such as the critical consciousness scale [1] to examine students' levels of critical consciousness awareness at the beginning of the semester. Preliminary findings on students' understanding of critical consciousness demonstrate an initial misconception of the term critical consciousness, possibly due to limited exposure to the concept. However, after engaging in lessons on gaining awareness of various forms of oppression within the educational system, students exhibited feelings of validation for their own experiences. Towards the end of the course, students were able to identify ways in which systemic oppression manifested itself in CS contexts and devised plans for collectively combating these injustices. This data underscores the need for more opportunities for the development of critical consciousness, emphasizing its dual significance in both understanding systemic and social barriers that limit Hispanic students' access to CS education and the workforce. This skill is necessary for propelling students to take action in challenging barriers, especially in a stratified technological world.";

To provide useful information for developing appropriate curricula, we investigated the actual textbooks traditionally used in CS by applying the latent Dirichlet allocation to actual textbooks. In this paper, we focused on the topic progression of the textbooks and showed the results of clustering analysis with sequence clustering. We discovered that the structure of CS textbooks can be explained by five or six topics, and that dynamic time warping (DTW) can classify knowledge areas for CS more appropriately than the LDA-based clustering without DTW.";

bibo:abstract "RWTH Aachen University in Germany offers a bridge course that introduces students of a variety of study programs to the basics of imperative programming. Due to the high number of students and limited availability of tutors, it is hard to provide instant individual feedback to all students, to notice how difficult the tasks are for the students, and to reliably monitor their progression during the course. This motivated us to use an Automatic Program Assessment System (APAS) to provide instant formative feedback to students and to systematically assess the course’s tasks. In this paper, we present our study in which we investigated (1) if the use of our APAS influences the students’ perceived difficulty of the programming tasks, (2) whether the use of our APAS increases the students’ progression speed, and (3) if the number of automated assessments triggered by the students can serve as an indicator of a task’s perceived difficulty. The results did not allow us to identify any meaningful differences between the study and control group with regards to the perceived difficulty and the progression speed. We found that the number of automated assessments can serve as a rough indicator for the task’s perceived difficulty. We also found initial indication that the use of the automated assessment helps to ensure that the students complete the tasks in full and as intended by the teachers and might improve code quality. This needs to be further investigated in future work.";

bibo:abstract "Games are created for humanity to get money, for business for the creators and to get fun as an entertainment for clients or gamers, however, they are focused on helping to get pleasant experiences. In recent years, due to the increasing use of technology, miniaturization and portability of electronic devices, new educational strategies for digital natives students, and the proliferation of mental illnesses associated to anxiety stress and depression, games have played an important role in the wellness of humanity and have moved to fields where they were not commonly used. Education is a field that has been visibly invaded by games; therefore, two teams of research fields have been created: games-based learning education and gamification. Game-based learning uses games to enhance the learning experience whilst gamification applies elements of games in non-games contexts. This paper explains the development of a gamification exercise for university students. The gamified proposal was focused of software development projects using technical skills and motivates the participation and engagement of students in basic activities as listening, reading, speaking, writing and develops transversal skills activities as negotiation, taking decisions and testing software. Finally, the purpose of the exercised is to decrease the plagiarism of software projects.";

bibo:abstract "Before the technological revolution, persuasion occurred in a transactional manner in public forms or academic settings. Persuasive design now enables a unidirectional process through mobile apps and other digital media. However, sometimes persuasive design may translate to consumer risk or inadvertent outcomes. Several studies have shown persuasive design's negative and potentially harmful impacts in apps such as social media and gaming. In the overly competitive digital mobile apps market, app design engineers are steered by business drivers to attract and highly-engage users. Within this context, app designers may intentionally adopt psychologically based design elements to drive higher levels of user-engagement. As evident from several apps recently analyzed in research and legal hearings, ethical considerations of apps influence on user behaviors, choice, and wellbeing may be eclipsed in favor of business outcomes. In this study, we examine how by utilizing ethical safeguards and psychological competencies can inform innovative app design to influence human behavior to optimize consumer wellness in a targeted fashion. To this end, we propose a research collaboration between computer science and psychology to promote student understanding and incorporation of design factors that could influence user well-being. This work utilizes three main principle persuasive design, choice architecture, and participatory design to define a usable framework. We argue that knowledge of brain-behavior principles such as behavior change mechanisms, the integration of bottom-up and top-down processing, and the inclusion of measurement capabilities for target behaviors could support the development of efficacious and engaging apps via positive and ethically appropriate mechanisms. Our proposed collaborative model integrates guidelines for ethical app development with the ultimate goal of giving computer science students a framework for understanding app design as a structure for consumer choice architecture. We target Computer Science undergraduate students enrolled in the capstone design project at the Texas A&M University System (TAMUC) – RELLIS Campus. To complete the capstone project, students enroll in two consecutive courses, CSCI 359 (Fall) and CSCI 440 (Spring), where they work to produce a software product (app). The capstone walks students through ideation, planning, design, implementation, and testing of their software (app) products. The framework and tools developed as part of this study are evaluated for effectiveness through discussions and student reflections.";

In these courses, students are given a problem of some complexity, and are expected to exercise and develop problem-solving skills as they address the problem. Within our Computer Science and Engineering program we have, over the past eight years, successfully scaled up the Capstone courses. Doing so has required innovative thinking about the roles of the students, faculty, and project sponsors. In this paper, we discuss issues with scaling up the components that have made this program successful. These include housing the courses in an NSF IUCRC that enable the cultivation of highly-committed industry partners, the creation of strong pre-requisite courses, careful development of faculty resources through the selective hiring and mentoring of clinical faculty, a commitment of the faculty to give up close management and control, strong partnerships with other organizations within the university to provide students greater access to resources, an emphasis on cross-team knowledge sharing and learning, and the development of unique assessment and evaluation tools so as to be able to monitor, measure and fairly assess a wide-spectrum of projects.";

bibo:abstract "This article investigates the integration of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in the realm of generative art and interactive digital installations. The study focuses on how these advanced algorithms can enhance artistic expression and interactivity, providing novel approaches for generating and optimizing art. Key innovations include the application of VAEs to create diverse and complex art forms, coupled with PSO to fine-tune these generative processes. The research demonstrates that VAEs significantly improve the aesthetic quality and variety of generated artworks, achieving an average aesthetic score of 8.3 out of 10. Integrating PSO further optimizes these results, enhancing the quality of outputs with a final score of 9.0. The study also reveals that this combination improves user engagement and satisfaction, with interactive installations utilizing VAE + PSO achieving a satisfaction score of 9.0, compared to 7.0 for traditional methods. The findings highlight the transformative impact of these algorithms on art generation, showing that while computational resources and time are higher, the artistic and interactive benefits are substantial. This research underscores the potential of combining deep learning and optimization techniques to push the boundaries of digital creativity and offers new perspectives for artists and designers. The article concludes that the synergy of VAEs and PSO represents a significant advancement in generative art and interactive installations, opening new avenues for future exploration and development in the field.";

bibo:abstract "This Research Full Paper examines changes in computer science (CS) students' achievement goals. The types of goals students set impact other things such as self-regulation strategies and learning, and evidence indicates that the kinds of goals students set and pursue within a class shift during the course of that class. A $3 \\times 2$ goal orientation framework was used to explore shifts in undergraduate CS students' goals. This study contributes to the research literature on changes in CS students' goals and extends previous work by using multiple analytic techniques to examine students in upper-level courses as well as factors that might be associated with changes in goals. Study 1 examined students in 100-level courses and Study 2 examined students in more advanced courses. The primary research questions addressed in both studies were (1) how do the goals of undergraduate CS students change during the semester? and (2) are changes in goals different for men and women or for CS majors and non-majors? Students self-reported the perceived importance of the various types of achievement goals at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. Study 1 results indicated that on average, 100-level students' ratings of the importance of all types of goals except task/work avoidance goals changed across the semester. Individual-level analyses revealed that comparable proportions of students demonstrated increases and decreases in this type of goal, resulting in the lack of change at the group level. Some of the goal types differed according to major status, and only task approach goals showed any gender effects. Study 2 found that on average students in upper-level courses similarly demonstrated significant decreases in all approach goals and performance avoidance goals during the semester. Task/work avoidance goals again did not change significantly overall, but again comparable proportions of students demonstrated increases and decreases. Task/work avoidance goals also differed according to major status. For task approach goals, all interactions and main effects except the main effect of gender were significant. Non-major women had the lowest task approach goals and the most change, but CS-major women had the highest task approach goals and the least change. In both studies, performance avoidance goals had the greatest proportion of students demonstrating reliable change. The findings of these studies indicate that students' goals tend to become more maladaptive over time, might differ for majors and non-majors in lower-level courses, and the factors related to shifts in goals might be more complex in more advanced courses.";

bibo:abstract "Due to the limitations of time and resources, many undergraduate software engineering courses provide a survey of a broad range of development approaches rather than the experience of software production in a real-life setting. In this paper, we propose an innovative learning environment that integrates our undergraduate software-engineering course with an application course in client/server computing. Such an environment allows students to apply software methodologies. This paper presents detailed class schedules for both courses for a 16-week regular semester to implement real-world applications and analyses the benefits of such a learning environment. Not all students in the software-engineering course are taking the client/server computing course, and vice versa. Therefore, team organization and student assessments become complicated and are discussed in the paper.";

bibo:abstract "Challenges related to gender equality are being researched by different institutions, universities, and companies worldwide. In particular, there are still gaps concerning higher education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Through a Rapid Review, this work aims to present the factors that affect women’s journey in STEM education in Brazil, mainly in engineering and computer science. More specifically, we seek to describe the barriers, motivators, and strategies present in the researched academic literature. Barriers include stereotypes, oppression, patriarchal relations, prejudice, segregation, isolation, lack of support from colleagues and teachers, judgment, fear of mathematics, and mansplaining – the unnecessary explanation made by a man of something a woman says. Motivators include support from the school and teachers, exposure to the STEM area during high school, teamwork, and support from family, friends, and classmates. The strategies to overcome barriers women face in STEM education include exposure to STEM topics, the inclusion of teachers in encouraging and training, role models, participation in technological competitions, a friendly environment, and women participating in technical evaluators’ work. This work presented data revealing women’s challenges in STEM, highlighting existing barriers, motivators, and strategies tested to address the low female participation. This information significantly expands the discussion on this topic, especially in the labor market and education. In our view, quality and excellence depend on an inclusive policy where selection is based solely on merit, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or religion.";

bibo:abstract "The advancement of computer science has led to significant transformations in the educational approach adopted by colleges and universities. This shift has emphasized independent learning behaviors, particularly informal learning. Consequently, there is a growing need to incorporate the planning and design of informal learning spaces into campus development strategies. This paper presents an analysis of the characteristics of informal learning behaviors observed on campus, as well as an exploration of the underlying demands associated with such activities. Based on these findings, the article proposes the strategic placement of informal learning spaces within campus planning. This proposition is examined from three distinct perspectives: the functional configuration, spatial structure, and place-making represent the macro-meso-micro levels. The paper takes the campus planning design of Guangdong Hotel Management College as an example to explore the strategies employed and the effectiveness achieved in facilitating informal learning. Furthermore, we focus on three key aspects: the multi-level informal learning function system, the layout of shared informal learning spaces, and the creation of personalized informal learning environments.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: Using threshold concepts as the framework for curriculum design, a project on neural network methods for solving differential equations is presented, with a rich set of transformative concepts from mathematics and computer science. Projects of this kind complement a typical curriculum with expertise that is crucial for critique and fundamental development of modern machine learning. Background: The curricula of many schools of mathematics and computer science present a relatively shallow introduction to the other subject. Student projects, on the other hand, provide an effective environment for interdisciplinary research between the two disciplines. Intended Outcomes: Providing students from computer science and mathematics the opportunity to obtain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the other subject, beyond the confines of the school curriculum. Application Design: The project contains tasks that require acquisition, not just of knowledge, but also of effective strategies and mental models, relevant to a set of transformative concepts from both disciplines. The tasks require a spectrum of activities, ranging from rigorous theoretical work to coding. Findings: Although the theory of threshold concepts needs further development, the existing paradigms provide a helpful framework for curriculum design. The continuous formative assessment proved effective in monitoring the participants’ journeys through the liminal state.";

bibo:abstract "The fast adoption of collaborative software development by the in-dustry allied with the demand for a short time to market has led to a dramatic change in IT roles. New practices, tools, and environments are available to support professionals in their day-to-day activities. In this context, the demand for software engineers with these skills continues to increase, specifically those related to Extreme Programming, Agile frameworks, CI/CD, and DevOps. To match Computer Science undergraduate students' skills with existing job offers, some universities have begun to include DevOps topics in their curriculums. However, due to the wide range of courses covered in Computer Science majors, it is particularly challenging to introduce DevOps within the context of Software Engineering fundamentals, i.e., connect abstract concepts to skills needed for software engineers in the industry. This paper investigates ways of introducing Computer Science students to industry-relevant practices and technologies early from two Software Engineering fundamentals courses. Student outcomes were extremely positive, providing insights into ways to introduce students to DevOps-related practices and technologies and bridge the gap between academia and industry.";

When considering higher education, Brazil has one of the highest university dropout rates in public and private institutions. Such a problem is considered a social loss as well as a misuse of resources. This paper aims to identify academic and social performance factors that influence the dropout of undergraduate students from Computer Science major at the University of Brasilia (UnB). The data set consists of 879 observations and 16 variables with aspects of the students enrolled in Computer Science from the first semester of 2014 to the second semester of 2019. The survival analysis methodology was employed, more specifically, the Log-Normal regression model, in which the response variable was the time (number of semesters) until dropout (known as failure time) or the last follow-up of the student (either the completion of the course or the student is still enrolled by 2019/2). The model proved to be robust in the residual analysis and in presenting results consistent with the dropout literature. This work can assist in the development of policies and educational strategies to decrease the number of dropouts in the computer science undergraduate major.";

bibo:abstract "During the last two and half years, the Covid-19 Pandemic has made online learning environment (OLE) a necessary modality for all educational degree programs globally. However, migrating a conventional ground campus only Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCE) degree program into an online modality is a project more complicated than simply replicating what is common in an on-ground classroom into a virtual classroom. The major challenges include how to maintain instructional effectiveness in an online modality, how to enable students accessing lab equipment to conduct hands-on experiments in an OLE, how to support students expeditiously when they encounter difficulties in an asynchronous communication based OLE, and how to assess students work produced in an OLE, etc. In this paper, we share our experience on how we applied a systematic approach, guided by various learning pedagogies, migrating a ground campus only ABET accredited BSCE degree program into the online modality successfully. Our practice has demonstrated that this approach can assist us to quickly identify solutions, quite often unique to the OLE, based on the specific characteristics of online modality to effectively address various typical challenges encountered during the process of migration.";

bibo:abstract "Brain activity analysis can be used to determine an individual's mental state while performing a certain task. This study examined the learners’ brain activity changes, the correlation between their performances in reading tasks and answering exercises, and regression analysis to determine the significant impact of mental load tasks on the performance score of the learners. This experiment involved 15 learners, performing eleven (11) tasks which included reading, exercise questions, and coding tasks at their own pace while wearing EmotivEpocX brainware technology. The EEG signals collected were processed to compute the absolute power spectra that served as input values for analysis. Findings in this study revealed that the learners exhibited a frequency band BETA classified as \"high mental load,\" indicating that learners were actively engaged and alert in performing the tasks, and there were no significant differences based on Gamma, Beta, Alpha, and Theta. Moreover, the correlation analysis revealed that the mental load tasks were not statistically significant since the p-value of the variables in between was greater than the 0.05 level of significance. Likewise, regression analysis showed that the brain activity, having a \"high mental load\" had no significant impact or relationship on the learners' over-all performance score with an F-statistic of 0.9293. As all the p-value of the task coefficients were found to be greater than the significant level, the teaching-learning activities must be revisited to further improve the analytical and logical skills of the learners and serve as a strong basis for educational strategists to manage the activities and avoid information overload that clearly affects the learners' performance.";

bibo:abstract "This is a full research paper. Integrity in the detection of plagiarism in students' source codes in university programming courses is a research topic for instructors and institutions seeking to improve the quality of their teaching. In particular, introductory courses such as CS1, are of paramount importance, as this is when students gain fundamental knowledge to build their future on. With the latest developments in Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc., methods of plagiarism have evolved, however methods of detection may not be capable of accurately differentiating between code generated by human and artificial intelligence (AI). In this context, this paper seeks to answer the research question: What does the current literature report on AI generated code plagiarism detection in higher education? To expand on and formulate a comprehensive answer to our research question (RQ), we have formulated six sub-questions: RQ1) How many papers were published per year by country?; RQ2) Which conferences and journals have published most papers on this subject?; RQ3) Which plagiarism detection tools were most often used prior to common AI use?; RQ4) How are educators adapting assignments to minimize the use of AI?; RQ5) Which modern methods are being deployed to specifically detect AI?; RQ6) Which data sources and languages are most prevalent in the literature? The methodology was based on a systematic literature review. Initially, we confined our search for literature to Scopus and Web of Science, however additional literature was included from Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria were applied to include documents from the years 2023 and 2024 (after the launch of ChatGPT), and only published by conferences and journals. Exclusion criteria: papers that do not focus on plagiarism and programming courses; papers that are not about the undergraduate-level; papers not written in English. We found 165 papers via Scopus and WebScience, from which the metadata were collected, resulting in 17 relevant papers selected for this work. The second step was a search in Google Scholar, where we analyzed 200 documents from 2023 (100 relevant documents) and 2024 (100 relevant documents). We used the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, however, we included the ArXiv papers, and found 9 more papers. Following this process, we have identified 26 papers to include in this literary mapping. In this paper we present the answers to these research questions and discussions about this research topic.";

<http://www.ieeeLOD.org/2025/03/scientific/data#10.1109/MCSE.2023.3326436> bibo:abstract "High-performance computing (HPC) has become an indispensable tool for solving diverse problems in science and engineering. Harnessing the power of HPC is not just a matter of efficient computation, however; it also calls for the efficient management of vast quantities of scientific data. This presents daunting challenges: rapidly evolving storage technology has motivated a shift toward increasingly complex, heterogeneous storage architectures that are difficult to optimize, and scientific data management needs have become every bit as diverse as the application domains that drive them. There is a clear need for agile, adaptable storage solutions that can be customized for the task and platform at hand. This motivated the establishment of the Mochi composable data service project. The Mochi project provides a library of robust, reusable, modular, and connectable data management components and microservices along with a methodology for composing them into specialized distributed data services. Mochi enables rapid deployment of custom data services with a high degree of developer productivity while still effectively leveraging cutting-edge HPC hardware. This article explores how the principles of translational computer science have been applied in practice in Mochi to achieve these goals.";

Engineering educators have been working for several years on how best to integrate CBL into computing courses, recognizing CBL's role in fostering crucial skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. At FIE 2023, we proposed a possible scaffold named “Choose Your Own Adventure in Challenge-Based Learning” (CYOA-CBL) that aimed to make CBL more adaptable and empower the students to personalise their experience, positioning themselves in a spectrum ranging from a more open and creative approach to a more structured and guided CBL experience. During the past academic year, we implemented CYOA-CBL in a mandatory four-month course at a medium-sized European university. With this work, we present the results we got from a qualitative study where we used mixed methods of data collection to evaluate CYOA-CBL and verify whether students understood the course process. In this paper, we discuss how students tended to adopt both open and structured approach and they appreciated the flexible nature of the course, leveraging the opportunity to change their path during the process to adapt it to their challenges. Students also valued the recurring structure of CYOA-CBL mentoring and tutorials and they had a general good understanding of the “next steps” to perform. At the same time, they highlighted the need to improve the tutorials, even if in a controversial way.";

bibo:abstract "This research full paper describes an investigation of nontraditional undergraduate Computer Science (CS) students' unique retention issues by using machine learning. It presents new insight into the most critical factors impacting their retention compared to traditional students. CS student retention is a pressing concern for many universities. Traditional students have been well-studied, but the growing number of nontraditional students have received less attention. These students often face unique challenges due to their different backgrounds and experiences compared to their traditional counterparts. For example, they typically delay postsecondary enrollment, have dependents, and attend school part time. Existing research has limited information on how these varying characteristics influence their academic success. Consequently, applying retention strategies based solely on traditional student data might not be effective for nontra-ditional students. This study aims to bridge the knowledge gap regarding nontraditional undergraduate CS student retention. We proposed two key questions: (1) What are the primary factors influencing nontraditional undergraduate CS student attrition? and (2) How can we predicate students at a higher risk of dropping out at an earlier stage? We analyzed the data of nontraditional undergraduate students enrolled in the CS major at a university with a predominantly nontraditional student population. The data span 13 years and encompass demographic, academic, and behavioral features. We trained five machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Trees) and an ensemble model. By considering both accuracy and AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the optimized models, we found that overall, the Gradient Boosting Trees model performs the best. Using permutation importance in the Gradient Boosting Trees model, we found nine most significant features impacting student retention: (1) GPA. Students with higher GPA (cumulative or in the last semester) are more likely to retain. (2) Course load. Students taking more classes overall or in a given semester tend to retain better. (3) Number of face-to-face classes taken. Students taking fewer face-to-face classes and more online classes are more likely to retain. (4) Age. Younger students tend to retain better. (5) Whether students transferred through a community college partnership. Students recruited through a partnership with two-year institutions tend to retain better. (6) Financial aid. Students with financial aid are less likely to drop out than students without any financial aid. These innovative findings deepen the knowledge of the specific retention challenges faced by nontraditional undergraduate CS students. This study successfully addressed the proposed research questions, providing valuable insights into nontraditional undergrad-uate CS student retention. Identifying key influential features improves the interpretability of the predictive models, leading to better compliance with regulations and reduced concerns about bias. Additionally, the optimized model can inform interventions and student services to enhance retention rates.";

bibo:abstract "Contribution: This study enhances the understanding of the factors that impact academic performance and self-efficacy among computer science (CS) students, specifically focusing on gender differences. Background: The motivation behind this study stems from the gender disparity observed within undergraduate CS programs. This gender gap undermines diversity within the tech industry and hampers its potential for innovation. Research Questions: Do female CS students exhibit lower levels of school belonging and academic self-efficacy? Are there gender differences in academic achievement? What is the predictive power of prior academic performance, academic self-efficacy, and sense of belonging on first-semester grades? Methodology: In this study, 113 undergraduate students (82 males) were surveyed. The questionnaire was administered midway through the semester, in early November. High school math exam scores were assessed along with self-reported measures of academic self-efficacy and sense of belonging. Findings: The findings revealed several noteworthy observations: Female students exhibited a statistically significant higher grade point average (GPA) at the end of the first semester despite reporting lower levels of academic self-efficacy. Regression analysis identified gender, academic self-efficacy, and high school math exam scores as significant predictors of first-semester GPA. Implications: The implications of the study underscore the importance of fostering a supportive learning environment within CS education. Specifically, this study advocates for implementing teaching practices that prioritize social aspects and help enhance field-specific self-efficacy for all students.";

Specifically, two computer science workshops were deployed for young girls in fourth and fifth grade as part of a larger Girl Scouts of America initiative. These workshops embrace playfulness as a fundamental design constraint to ensure an early positive association with STEM concepts. Students are exposed to basic coding skills through simple robots that are programmed to play games. Survey results show that these workshops lead to a stronger interest in CS for the participants.";

Cybersecurity has end up an trouble of essential importance inside the cutting-edge virtual world. By making it feasible to become aware of and respond to threats in actual time, Deep Learning is a important issue of progressed security. Adversarial assaults, interpretability of models, and a lack of categorized statistics are all obstacles that want to be studied further with the intention to support DL-based totally security solutions. The protection and reliability of DL in our on-line world relies upon on being able to triumph over those boundaries. The present studies presents a unique method for strengthening DL-based totally cybersecurity, known as name dynamic adverse resilience for deep learning-based totally cybersecurity (DARDL-C). DARDL-C gives a dynamic and adaptable framework to counter antagonistic assaults by using combining adaptive neural community architectures with ensemble learning, real-time threat tracking, risk intelligence integration, explainable AI (XAI) for version interpretability, and reinforcement getting to know for adaptive defense techniques. The cause of this generation is to make DL fashions more secure and proof against the constantly transferring nature of online threats. The importance of simulation evaluation in determining DARDL-C's effectiveness in practical settings with out compromising genuine safety is important. Professionals and researchers can compare the efficacy and versatility of DARDL-C with the aid of simulating realistic threats in managed contexts.

Complexity is a key concept in much of cognitive science, yet the field has scarcely incorporated any of the work in complexity theory. Complexity theory may generally be too abstract to easily apply to human cognition studies. Here, the problem is addressed by considering complexity through constructing a model of epistemic emergence, Cognitive-Habitat Strategy-Ecosystem, (CHSE) to act as an overarching framework into which different conceptions of complexity and cognition can be integrated, describing how they will interact to affect cognition in complex systems. This model provides value both at the micro level, by generating specific predictions, and at the macro level, through hypothesizing interactions between other cognitive theories such as cognitive load and adaptation from failure. We detail the model’s assumptions, functionality, and possible ways to measure variables.";

As in most institutions, CS1 is a challenge for students at the University of Brasilia, one of the top 10 universities in Brazil. In 2012, the Brazilian higher education system changed with an affirmative-action policy to admit more students from the public K-12 system: the “Quota” Law was implemented at all federal public universities. This paper aims to answer two research questions: 1) What knowledge about the positive/negative impact of certain features on the success of a CS1 course can be discovered from mining educational data augmented by social-economic information? 2) Are these features different between quota and non-quota students? The analysis uses social-economic and academic performance data of undergraduate students from 2012 to 2019. Data mining algorithms such as generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, and random forest were applied to the data. The findings include: (1) the relevance of indicators such as the consumption rate of university-subsidized meals, (2) that gender is not a determining factor in failure/success, and (3) a higher failure rate for quota students in the Computer Engineering and Mechatronics Engineering majors.";

bibo:abstract "We describe an instructional approach to enhance mathematical orientation in programming skills among beginning computer science students. We were motivated by the belief that adequate mathematical education is a crucial component in a programmer's training, since mathematical skills are an indispensable component of a proficient programmers' knowledge. We use elementary mathematics to anchor the new CS knowledge and skills, by engaging the students in solving authentic mathematically oriented problems, whose solutions require mathematical inquiry, as well as mathematically oriented programming skills. Solving problems of this type continuously throughout CS studies enables the students to grasp the CS professional work, and in particular the role of mathematics in the work of proficient programmers. We describe three examples of problems, for which we analyze the advantage of using mathematics and recommend pedagogical activity accordingly. We also exemplify and analyze the implementation of our approach in class.";

bibo:abstract "With the mainstream adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last year, members of both academia and the media have raised concerns around the potential impact on student learning and pedagogy. Many students and educators wonder about the pedagogical fit of this emerging technology. We aim to measure the adoption and perception of LLMs among the CS education community in an R1 University to distinguish reality from hype. To this end, we conduct a large survey study targeting three populations participating in computing courses at the university: intro-sequence students (ISS), experienced students (ES), and faculty. Our survey seeks to gather insight around the different populations' perceptions of LLMs in education, as well as how these perceptions may be changing as LLMs improve. Our results show several significant differences across the views of 760 respondents. Most students report LLMs' un-paralleled potential for quick information access, yet many harbor concerns about their reliability and impact on academic integrity. Additionally, while ES rapidly integrate LLMs into their learning, ISS and faculty remain cautious, highlighting a stark contrast in adoption rates. Faculty are unconvinced of LLMs' educational benefits and are concerned about potential challenges in evaluating students' learning outcomes. LLMs are reshaping pedagogical approaches and student engagement. However, with the notable reservations expressed by certain segments, particularly by faculty and ISS, there is an imperative for careful, informed, and ethical integration to ensure that these tools enhance rather than compromise the educational experience.";

bibo:abstract "Tumors are abnormal growths of tissue that can either be malignant or benign. Malignant tumors indicate cancer, while benign tumors are generally minimally harmful. The difference between the two is not evidence at first glance, and many tests must be conducted to identify it. Tumors need to be determined at an early stage, considering that treatments are most effective during the early stages of cancer when it has still not yet infected a lot of cells. Computer Vision is a technology that enables computers to simulate the “perceiving the real world” phenomena. With it, computers can create analyses and conclusions based on different images provided. With computer vision, a good data set is essential. Data Science makes use of different preprocessing techniques that aid in analyzing data. Applying different preprocessing methods to a data set allows the creation of high-quality data that can be used as a training data set for computer vision models. There are various computer vision models; the models that will be discussed are CapsNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and GoogLeNet. Concurrently, their accuracy and performance would be compared to each other. Furthermore, the importance of data science relative to computer vision will also be discussed. The increase in accuracy of having preprocessed high-quality data as a data set for computer vision models will also be measured.";

bibo:abstract "A new era of computational efficacy and problem-solving abilities has begun with the combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and computer science methods. It is crucial in modern computing to combine RNNs with methods from the field of computer science. RNNs bring a dynamic learning paradigm, making algorithms more efficient and flexible by allowing them to process sequential input and complicated dependencies. Their usefulness goes beyond one specific area of study, and into others such as optimization issues, recommendation systems, image processing, and natural language processing. RNNs serve a vital role in addressing the severe challenges that algorithms confront, including processing sequential input, identifying temporal connections, and optimizing in high-dimensional environments. By providing dynamic and adaptive modeling, RNNs aid algorithms in navigating these obstacles. Recurrent Neural Network-Based Optimization Algorithm (RNN-OA) is an innovative novel approach presented in this research. RNN-OA is an approach to algorithmic optimization that makes use of RNNs' dynamic learning capability. Mechanisms for selective data processing with attention, regularization methods for model stability, and interpretability improvements for openness are all a part of it. Quickening the process of optimization in many different types of problems is transfer learning and fine-tuning approaches. There are a wide variety of computer science fields where RNN-OA can be useful. Time-series analysis, language modeling, picture recognition, and recommendation systems all benefit greatly from its ability to handle sequential data. The efficacy, scalability, and robustness of the method are thoroughly evaluated by simulating various problem scenarios and data streams. The results of these simulations provide illumination for the benefits and drawbacks of RNN-OA, paving the way for its development toward actual application in algorithmic optimization.";

These technologies emphasize the fact that learning is not always linked to an institution or a period of time. However institutional learning systems do not support this concept and this makes necessary the definition of Personal Learning Environments. These new learning environments do not to replace the traditional ones so the coexistence is necessary. This paper describes the experience of the application of one of those personal environments implemented for mobile devices that is able to exchange information with the institutional systems. From this experience it is possible to say the definition of mobile Personal Learning Environments is possible, it increases learners' motivation and enriches their learning; and at the same time it is possible to take into account what the learners do beyond the institution.";

This study delineates the course choice opportunities (i.e. free electives, technical electives, etc.) and balance of required technical and non-technical coursework in 62 computer science and computer engineering programs spanning 35 U.S. News & World Report top-ranked engineering colleges. Students in the studied computer science and engineering programs were afforded a median of 3% of their degree program as free electives and choices in 49% of total course selections. Across the same universities, other engineering disciplines provided even less choice (median 1% free electives and 39% total choice); in contrast, chemistry, math, and physics programs allotted a median of 17% free electives and choice in 67% of course selections. The computer science and engineering programs required a median of 74% technical coursework (engineering, math and natural science) and 23% non-technical coursework; students in these programs experience less curricular balance than their natural science and math peers. Flexible and balanced degree programs in computer science and engineering exist and may appeal to a broader sector of students, facilitate in-migration and on-time graduation, and reflect evolving societal needs.";

Self-affirmation is the process whereby an individual focuses on important and positive aspects of their life with the aim of affirming their sense of self-worth and value. This positive self-regard makes individuals more accepting of negative feedback. The grounded theory approach employed in this substantive study provides a unique insight into the students' perspective of the key factors that influences their perceived success. Self-affirmation processes emerged as a key element of this theory and merit inclusion in future efforts to support and scaffold freshman learning in computer science.";

During the semester, students were encouraged to engage with ChatGPT. Our findings highlight the tool's multifaceted use in an academic settings, establishing it as a valuable resource for a variety of learning tasks. Most students have incorporated ChatGPT into their regular academic activities and view it as a beneficial aid. They perceive it as a multi-task solver and anticipate significant advancements in its writing assistance features in the near future. Many, not only attribute high accuracy to it but think that it adheres to appropriate content and structural norms. Our results suggest that active confrontation with ChatGPT enhances understanding of its capabilities, limitations and autoregressive nature. Consequently, we recommend an approach of informed engagement that includes the distinction between language processing and genuine language understanding and a carefully crafted terminology.";

The COVID-19 pandemic forced us to switch to virtual conferencing, and many works have shown the benefits of virtual conferencing in terms of inclusivity and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We are moving toward the usual conferencing format as it appears that the pandemic is increasingly under control. However, the changes imposed during the period of the pandemic brought many essential lessons regarding conferencing social and environmental effects. A crucial task is gathering these community experiences to give directions on keeping the learned lessons post-COVID-19. We used the Euro-Par conference to combine these lessons in the Computer Science case. We show practical results that reinforce the marginal emissions of virtual conferencing compared to in-person conference travel. We also open the debate that rethinking the conferences' utility according to our objectives (scientific and ecologic) and being aware of social/geographical biases are essential factors in participating in and organizing post-COVID-19 conferences.";

This paper addresses this question by describing how the model has been applied to computer science research projects that involve students with different skill levels and experience. In particular, it presents example structured tasks and related activities that illustrate how students develop domain expertise, gain an understanding and appreciation of the research process and its practice, and acquire team, communication, problem-solving, and higher-level thinking skills.";

bibo:abstract "Women play a fundamental role in society, sustainable development, and the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry. In recent years it has been explicitly stated that society must invest in and facilitate scenarios for more women to find a space for professional development. In the ICT area, we find a perfect scenario for women to have valuable job opportunities with long-term projections since it is an area that fails to meet the need for professionals every year. However, the enrollment of women in universities and institutes that offer careers in ICT has not increased considerably over the years, and retention is not encouragingeither. This article aims to present an exploratory review to identify themotivations that drive young women to enter and remain until they graduatein a traditional career in Computer Science and to determine which professional roles are primarily associated with the female profile in this industry. The methodology applied consisted of a systematicmapping of the literature relevant to the study, which is complemented with a case study analysis involving students and professional women in the discipline through surveys. As a result,we obtained a preliminary approach to principal motivations to enter and remain in a university career in ICT and if these aspects replicate the recurrent professional positions women perform in the area.";

bibo:abstract "New curricula initiatives are growing to meet nearfuture, industrial demand for computer science (CS) graduates with Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) development knowledge. Universities are often at the forefront in developing these curricula to help prepare their students for industry jobs. High schools wanting to offer college aligned CS courses for their students typically work with local universities to adapt courses for their students' needs. This paper presents such an effort along with results from a student survey showing the successful implementation of college-level courses through training of high school teachers. The curricula from this study are available for public use at artncoding.com and may be adapted as needed by educational programs to meet the emerging employment needs of their students in the AR/VR field.";

By the end of the study we will collect this data into a survey and a questionnaire, where we will ask students for feedback about the process and tool. In addition to analyzing the results, by the end of the semester we will also compare the marks obtained by our subject students with the marks of the rest of the class.";

bibo:abstract "To better understand publication data in the context of a single journal and potentially provide alternative measurements of scientific authors' performance and projected paper quality as a first step, this work analyzes journal data through social media analysis and natural language processing techniques. This paper describes the process of enriching and analyzing bibliometric data by creating a co-author network and calculating multiple node properties, which are compared to traditional bibliometric measurements. Furthermore, communities are extracted, and the averaged bibliometric properties of authors in those communities are compared to various community properties. Finally, the abstract and title length and readability were calculated and compared to the citation counts of respective papers. The comparison of the aforementioned values did not indicate a strong correlation among any of the values. However, some of the properties were slightly correlated. The analysis reveals that a single journal co-authorship network is not enough to extract meaningful alternative measurements for academic performance of authors or papers. However, it also indicates that network properties and readability measures could be potentially successfully leveraged to extract alternative performance indicators with a larger dataset.";

The current paper proposal is to move this deployment in the cloud, enabling higher usability, efficient resource allocation and more control of the learning environment by the teacher. The solution is based on a Virtual Machine Management platform and a web interface that can both be deployed in the university cloud, enabling access to virtually any computer with network access.

In the context of computer education, as in other areas, it is necessary to take into account the different teaching methodologies for the different profiles of students, which can exert a positive influence on learning. Therefore, correlating the psychological profile of students with the methodology is an important research opportunity. In this study, the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) indicator was used to define the psychological profile of students. The methodology adopted for the development of the research was an exploratory study. Thus, this is a work that has the theme to demotivate the students in the language teaching and to extract the main instruments used to identify the types of personality of the individual and all his theory involved. From the results of the exploratory study and the psychological profile, a statistical regression technique was used to identify correlations. The results show that the psychological profiles can influence the student's acceptance and motivation in relation to the methodology applied in the classroom. This work is expected to motivate institutions and teaching professionals to create a motivational and more specialized learning environment for students.";

bibo:abstract "This study investigates the effectiveness of various computational models in classifying scientific abstracts from arXiv. It compares traditional machine learning methods— Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—with advanced transformer-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT. The methodology encompasses data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Results show that transformer-based models, while computationally intensive, offer competitive precision scores compared to traditional methods. Specifically, BERT-base-uncased achieved a precision of 0.949 with a total training time of 4720.6 seconds. In comparison, traditional methods like Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM exhibited precisions of 0.917, 0.966, and 0.965, respectively, with significantly lower training times of 5.48, 19.86, and 61.73 seconds. RoBERTa and DistilBERT, other transformer-based models, achieved precisions of 0.961 and 0.962, respectively, with training times of 4488.35 and 952.34 seconds. These results highlight the trade-off between computational cost and performance in advanced NLP models. Traditional models demonstrated faster training times but slightly lower precision, emphasizing the need for balancing efficiency and accuracy in real-world applications. This research underscores the potential of transformer-based models to enhance the organization and retrieval of information in large scientific datasets, offering valuable insights.";

bibo:abstract "Classroom environments that build a sense of belonging and identity in computer science (CS) for all students, especially those who have been historically excluded, are critical for equitable CS education. Providing professional learning that supports more inclusive and culturally sustaining CS classrooms at the scale needed to ensure that all students have positive experiences in CS is a significant challenge. This experience report discusses how the Scaling Inclusive Pedagogy (ScIP) project has approached this problem. ScIP aims to provide teachers with equity-focused professional learning experiences and research-based tools so they are equipped to embrace diversity and focus on equity in their schools and classrooms. We discuss key takeaways from teacher, facilitator, and organizational perspectives about developing a professional learning experience that balances the need for building community and safe spaces to converse about sensitive topics with the complexities of creating a large-scale effort that can reach thousands of teachers. This report highlights lessons learned about designing professional learning that is substantive enough to enact change but realistic for the demands on teachers’ time, nuanced and relevant to local contexts while also nationally scalable, and specific to and actionable for K-12 CS teachers. We reflect on persistent challenges and recommendations for taking an approach to CS teacher professional learning that is systemic enough to change what is happening in classrooms across the country.";

bibo:abstract "This research paper explores the prevalence of the Impostor Phenomenon (IP) among undergraduate college students in computer science (CS) courses, addressing its variations concerning different student demographics such as gender, ethnicity, and institutional background. We surveyed 502 students from two Southeastern U.S. institutions-one in Georgia and one in Florida-using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS). We found that 63% of our participants reported experiencing IP, with higher rates among female students (68%) compared to males (62 %) and those of other gender identities (46 %). Our findings also suggest that IP experiences are significantly influenced by the interplay of students' gender and their institutional context. At the first institution (Georgia Institute of Technology), IP was found in 58% of female students and 65% of male students, compared to 29% among students with other gender identities. At the second institution (University of Florida), these figures were 80% for females, 57% for males, and 67% for students with other gender identities. Our study underscores the importance of developing targeted support strategies within the CS education community to address the high prevalence of IP, particularly considering its varying impact across different demographics and institutional contexts.";

With a growing interest in these practices, some secondary literature has been published within this research area. However, there are still open questions when it comes to teaching such practices to computer science students. With more and more companies demanding these skills from graduated students, educating them the required knowledge and skills is necessary. This systematic literature review follows the methodology of Kitchenham and analyses which of these practices are taught in higher computer science education. Along with the kind of courses that use them, it is reviewed how they are taught in higher computer science education and how these approaches differ from each other. The systematic literature review points out, that there are currently different teaching approaches described in literature. The review might help educators to gain new ideas of how to develop an own course to teach such practices or how to implement such contents into existing courses.";

bibo:abstract "Introductory Computer Science (CS) programs at higher education institutions include a variety of introductory courses commonly known as CS1 and CS2; some institutions offer additional variations (e.g., CS0, CS1.5). Accurate placement of students in these courses is vital for students' success. This paper introduces a machine learning-based CS placement test system using LLMs and classifiers, incorporating a concept inventory (CI) assessment. Five LLMs were evaluated, and the best one was chosen to generate questions. The questions were stored in a database, allowing customized placement tests through an interactive assessment system. After the test, students' performance data were used to train three simple MLP classifiers, achieving over 83% accuracy in a case study with 46 participants.";

bibo:abstract "Quantum computing presents a transformative potential for the world of computing. However, integrating this technology into the curriculum for computer science students who lack prior exposure to quantum mechanics and advanced mathematics remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a scaffolded learning approach aimed at equipping computer science students with essential quantum principles. By introducing foundational quantum concepts through relatable analogies and a layered learning approach based on classical computation, this approach seeks to bridge the gap between classical and quantum computing. This differs from previous approaches which build quantum computing fundamentals from the prerequisite of linear algebra and mathematics. The paper offers a considered set of intuitive analogies for foundation quantum concepts including entanglement, superposition, quantum data structures and quantum algorithms. These analogies coupled with a computing-based layered learning approach, lay the groundwork for a comprehensive teaching methodology tailored for undergraduate third level computer science students.";

bibo:abstract "Since the emergence of the “complex networks” field of study, very diverse practical problems have been addressed, based on the underlying concepts from graph theory, from finding the best path for delivering a thing or product to the analysis of how pandemics spread, but also to explain the disappearance of biological species, among many other applications. This work is a bibliometric study of publications on “complex networks” using Scopus database and developed in two phases. The first phase looks for a general picture and the second is focused on the information and communications technologies, considered by Scopus under the Engineering and Computer Sciences labels, from 27 subject areas. Results show that coincidentally Computer Sciences and Engineering are the two subject areas with most publications, both contribute with 47% of the total. Publications are leaded by China with 25% and the 95% of articles are published in English. Documents are published in 161 journals or proceedings, but just 14 of them published more than 500 documents each. Resulting information is useful for strategic management for the development of complex networks.";

bibo:abstract "Universities collect an enormous amount of student data that remains underutilized in helping decisions or policymaking. Strategies to deal with problems such as drop-out students and low achievers are imperative to the success of universities. Our work is motivated by the fact that student journey in a learning environment, such as a university, resembles a trajectory. The journey of the student is analogous to that of a vehicle trajectory, in which a student is similar to a vehicle which passes through different units/subjects instead of different geographical locations to reach a certain graduate outcome (destination). The trajectory concept provides a model to capture and represent a large amount of data collected by universities in a meaningful way. In this paper, we develop a trajectory model to capture the journey of students who are enrolled in Computer Science courses. We focus on several modelling aspects, including trajectory representation and trajectory clustering that can be applied to gain valuable insights on students' journeys through university, both at individual and collective levels.";

bibo:abstract "Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education is slowly becoming an important part of American culture. STEM educators try to promote `hands on' science, where students can actually interact with and see the results of their work. Unfortunately, not all paths of education for STEM related fields can have exciting, interactive teaching methods. At the Millard Oakley STEM Center, we have taken advantage of the interactive experience in our planetarium show. In this paper, we take an in-depth look at the Definiti Theater System and the software that runs it, Digital Sky 2. This software package is created by Sky-Skan and is considered to be the standard for many new planetariums across the country and beyond. We take the software in new directions by building new elements through the Sky-Skan scripting engine and by also exploring its 3D engine for creating a novel experience. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide a roadmap of observations and enhancements for other educators that wish to improve the learning experience of students and visitors to their planetarium.";

Student enrollment in the Computer Science (CS) department closely mirrors the ethnicity-related demographic statistics of the university as a whole, with more than half of CS majors identifying as students of color, bucking national trends. Students who identify as male in our department outweigh those who identify as female five to one, however: a ratio that is in line with national and global trends. These two phenomena place our department in an interesting place for diversity, equity, and inclusion research: we boast extremely strong inclusion rates for students of color in CS, but still struggle to recruit and retain women in our programs. An exploratory phenomenological case study of participatory action research was used to investigate the lived experiences of students from various backgrounds and gender identities within our department. Salient thematic codes were analyzed with dual purposes: 1) informing suggested improvements for the department for recruiting and retaining students of color and women, and 2) ensuring student participation and inclusion in the creation of new course evaluation questions that aim to gather more data about students' experiences across the entire department. Salient themes from the focus group included gender-neutral and ethnicity-neutral based experiences, the importance of female advocates and mentors, and international status concerns.";

bibo:abstract "One of the most significant changes in Higher Education pedagogy that has occurred over the past fifty years is the idea that university students should not just be taught theoretical subject knowledge but should engage with practical aspects of their course so developing the skills and professional competences that will allow them to gain successful employment after graduation. In this paper, we relate this development to the Aristotelian notion of intellectual virtue and specifically the concept of phronesis. We discuss the way in which this idea has developed from classical beginnings to the modern educational setting, and argue that the notion of phronesis, that is, practical wisdom or prudential judgement, is crucial to a range of activities which are fundamental to science, engineering and computing education. These include an understanding of what it means to engage in authentic learning and the solution of open-ended or ill-structured problems. We also discuss the role the concept plays in describing key features of work-based learning. Finally, we make some comments concerning the relative value the education system places on different types of knowledge, and why an appropriate understanding of phronesis allows for a proper appreciation of contingent knowledge within the curriculum.";

bibo:abstract "A web-based learning platform is useful as it allows students with limited or no programming background to conduct in-depth hands-on practice in data science. Background: The need for data science coursework for non-computing majors has grown in recent years, given the demand in various disciplines. However, a substantial number of current data science courses are inappropriate for non-computing majors as they typically require a long chain of prerequisite courses in computer science and mathematics. Moreover, courses designed for computing majors do not match the preparation and interests of students majoring in other disciplines. Outcomes: This paper presents a platform for Learning Data Science (DSLP), a web-based platform, which assists in the teaching and learning of data science topics by students with limited or no coding experience, including those that have completed a high school AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) class or an equivalent CSP course increasingly offered in many colleges. Application Design: The platform helps students understand fundamental data science concepts and techniques, as well as provides them with an in-depth hands-on experience that goes beyond their coding capabilities. The platform offers various data visualization supports to help students understand data and analysis results. Students can use the platform to work on in-house datasets or their own data. This allows students to focus more on how to solve data science problems in various domains than how to write code. The platform also has several unique features that make it particularly helpful for teaching and learning data science topics such as code exemplification and sandbox, informative instructions, and progress monitoring. Findings: The platform has been used multiple times in data science courses for non-computing majors offered at the authors' institution. Preliminary student feedback indicated that the platform is effective in terms of improving student understanding and interest in the topics.";

To find out this information, a Systematic Mapping Study has been carried out in IEEE, DBLP, Scopus, ACM and Web of Science databases. A total of 226 papers were selected as primary studies and 22 types of measurements were found, it was determined that the three most used measurements in computational experiments are performance at 51.33%, efficiency at 15.49%, and effectiveness at 15.04%. A total of 25 frameworks used for the computational experiments were determined, however 74.3% of the reports did not specify any framework used, 11.5% used a custom framework and the rest used a specific framework. It is concluded that performance is the most important measurement in computational experiments and that it is necessary for researchers to rely on a framework so that these experiments can be replicated or refined.";

bibo:abstract "This study investigates the citation practices of electrical engineering (EE) and computer science (CS) bachelor students. A citation category based coding scheme for content analysis was developed to study the academic writing genre, represented by final year thesis reports. The academic writing skill-set displayed by CS and EE bachelor students was gauged by interpretative content analysis of a corpus of full-text theses, retrieved from a university repository. Two research questions were addressed: 1) what are the citation practices, employed by two cohorts of final year bachelor students, in electrical engineering and computer science? 2) what use of academic writing genre conventions can be quantified through interpretative content analysis? The intention of the study was to categorize the purposes behind citation use in bachelor level theses. Both student cohorts displayed an exaggerated use of citations, deviating from fully mature academic writing practices in the CS and EE fields. Many factual statements of a general nature were supported by multiple and weakly motivated instances of citations to a limited set of sources. An apparent genre convention was to cite sources mainly in text segments of introductory or survey character. Hence the investigated bachelor level theses made little use of citations to support the choice of research question, method or in critical discussion of results.";

The capability of ChatGPT for instructional purposes is evaluated based on the responses to different questions about these engineering streams. This article explores different opportunities (with use cases), that ChatGPT can provide in augmenting the learning experience. It also provides scenarios of limitations and modifying the evaluation process to prevent the use of ChatGPT, which may lead to an inaccurate dissemination of accepted facts. In this paper, common classroom problems and their respective responses from ChatGPT in the domains of Computer Science, Cyber Security, Data Science, and Electrical Engineering are analyzed to determine the categories of queries for which ChatGPT offers reliable responses and those for which it may be factually incorrect.

bibo:abstract "This research-to-practice full paper aims to analyze the public's comments on generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in computer science (CS) education, by the BERT-based model and Large Language Model (LLM) approaches to sentiment analysis and contextualize the results within broader educational and technological landscapes. Artificial intelligence (AI) has played a crucial role in advancing technical development throughout many areas. Evidence points toward the likelihood of major developmental breakthroughs unfolding soon in those sectors. Education is one such area. While there is certainly a possibility for hype and unfulfilled promises, the advent of available GAI platforms, such as ChatGPT, has caused a surge of scholarly interest in the impact of these technologies on CS education. Amid the growing debate, both the potential benefits and concerns of GAI in this sector are increasingly coming to the fore as people grapple with the tradeoffs associated with these technologies when applied in education settings. One can imagine the range of conversations around the topic, but that is difficult to use as input for policymakers and administrators without a more concrete understanding. To wit, there remain open questions about which benefits and concerns people tend to focus on when discussing GAI in education. This large-scale qualitative study addresses that gap by exploring the public's perspectives on GAI in CS education. We engage in this work by collecting and analyzing data from social media platforms, specifically Reddit comments. The social media dataset was analyzed using machine learning (ML) techniques to identify topics based on sentiment analysis. The study's objective was to document and characterize the public's perspectives concerning the general characteristics of GAI, its features related to learning, and its usability in educational settings. Through sentiment analysis using Large Language Models (LLM), the study revealed an overall positive public perception toward using generative AI in CS education, with over 57% of comments being favorable, while also identifying prominent topics of interest and concerns, such as the potential benefits of personalized learning support and automated grading, as well as issues like academic dishonesty, perpetuation of biases, over-reliance on AI hindering critical thinking, displacement of human instructors, and the need for updated curricula. The insights gleaned from the analysis will be instrumental in computing educators gaining a more profound comprehension of GAI 'srole in education and the subsequent development of GAI -enriched curricula.";

bibo:abstract "AI research and development in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) can be seen as paradigmatic for the phase of late socialism. The imperatives of the socialist project and its economic ramifications in the endgame of the Cold War left a distinct imprint on AI. The GDR adopted a pragmatic approach to AI, which this article examines. It highlights the various strands and applications of late socialist AI research, encompassing both everyday applications and advanced scientific endeavors. Moving beyond the prevailing focus on U.S. research within the military-industrial complex, this article situates AI research within the broader history of the GDR, Central, and Eastern Europe. This study employs methods from science and technology studies to analyze AI objects, particularly chess computers, as indicators of the proliferation of AI within the everyday practices of the GDR. Through a thorough examination of a widely circulated computer magazine, this overview illustrates the diverse range of AI applications in the GDR, spanning areas such as planning, industrial management, state administration, science, public health, and pervasive surveillance. In this context, high-tech solutions were deployed alongside decaying industrial infrastructure, while utopian visions of intelligent machines intersected with ideological exhaustion, and health care applications were juxtaposed with fleeing doctors. These ambivalences reflect the complex state of the GDR in late socialism. Nevertheless, researchers and engineers worked on prototypes for image recognition, language processing, automatic reasoning and basic AI technologies, including programming languages and specialized hardware.";

bibo:abstract "Academic performance across Computer Science (CS) courses in the Republic of Ireland is underwhelming. CS undergraduates are statistically the most likely cohort in the country not to progress past year one of their studies. Insufficient motivation to pursue CS studies has been demonstrated to be a significant cause of poor CS academic performance. Goal-setting programs are an efficient, cost-effective, and student empowering way to boost motivation. Goal-setting is the formulation of a set of activities intended to motivate an individual to the desired goal state. This paper provides an experimental design for assessing the effectiveness of a written goal-setting program on academic performance concerning individual differences. Participants are randomly assigned either to the written goal-setting program or an active control task via an online platform. The goal-setting program requires participants to articulate both a desired future life and a feared future life. The program also requires participants to: identify goals and sub-goals across several domains (e.g. family, health, study); the benefits that achieving their goals would have for themselves for their connected group; the daily habits they could develop to make their ideal future more likely to occur. This study also investigates how personality (via a high-resolution personality model) and cognitive differences influence goal-setting effectiveness. Differences in both Semester 1 performance and the number of students who progress to Semester 2 are assessed between experimental groups. An ANCOVA analysis will assess whether the effectiveness of an experimental task varied based on individual differences in personality and/or cognitive ability.";

bibo:abstract "This innovative practice paper explores two differing approaches to the use of artificial intelligence tools in computer science classrooms. Artificial Intelligence (AI), while not a new technology, has seen a rise in popularity over the past two years, with companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft making readily available generative AI tools for anyone to use. This surge in AI popularity has led to a rise in its use in educational settings, in some cases allowed and in others discouraged or disallowed. A debate has risen among academics, particularly in higher education, about what AI's place in education is, with some educators actively encouraging its use while others view the use of AI as a form of academic dishonesty. Given AI is only advancing and is becoming more prevalent, it will only continue to become a more dominant force throughout education and the world at large. This paper presents two educators' distinct viewpoints and experiences on how AI should be handled in computer science courses (absolutely forbidden vs. decriminalized). The goal of this paper is to present different perspectives as well as concrete experiences we have had with AI in our own classrooms to encourage others to consider their own positions on its use and its implications for their own learning environments. While the debate on the place of AI in education is a long way from being settled, educators need to think about making choices, clearly articulating policies, and evaluating the positives and negatives of positions about AI in their classrooms.";

bibo:abstract "Teaching assistants (TAs) play a crucial role in Computer Science courses. When a student is stuck or confused, they often rely on a TA to help them understand a concept or debug their program. At the same time, TAs in Computer Science courses are often very new at teaching, and somewhat new at programming. They may lack the knowledge and resources necessary to help students learn effectively. This work seeks to better understand the nature of TA-student interactions and identify potential opportunities for improvement. We conducted an observational study of one-on-one TA-Student interactions during office hours of a Computer Science course, and analyzed these interactions through the lens of known practices of effective one-on-one tutors. We found that TA-Student interactions focus on code over concepts, and this focus may be detrimental to TAs’ use of good tutoring practices.";

bibo:abstract "Teaching machine learning is not only a balancing act between an appropriate amount of theory and practice. Beside relevant classic methods, it further needs to mind the state-of-the-art in a rapidly evolving field. Project-based learning approaches can aid translation of theory into practice, and serve as playground for modern methods. In addition, they foster advancement of various skills, crucial for working in teams. Ideally, projects topically align with study programs they are offered to, and address current and relevant problems. Joint courses offered to different programs thus display a demanding environment. The paper at hand presents insights into an implemented approach for a respective course environment, involving industrial projects of small extent with differentiated topics for various computer science Master programs. Students get in touch with industrial partners and apply in vogue methods, while traversing the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), respectively large parts of its counterpart for Machine Learning with Quality Assurance Methodology (CRISP-ML(Q)). Gathered experiences from student surveys from two iterations are reported, and challenges associated with conduction of the approach and project fulfillment are outlined. Further, perspectives on future course and approach adjustments are presented. A discussion states limitations in regards to its implementation and potential scope, and addresses emerging trends to mind. It concludes that once implemented, the approach aids program-specific teaching, proves scalable regarding provision to further programs, and can adapt to current progress in the field.";

bibo:abstract "The training of a professional in the area of computing involves understanding the process of building software. In the Computer Science course curricular guidelines, this training is a requirement for graduating from the course. For the construction of the Pedagogical Project of the Course (PPC), the In-stitutions observe reference documents for the development of the project according to the local/regional specificity. Dealing with computing courses, the National Curricular Guidelines (DCN) for Computing courses, the training references of the Brazil-ian Computing Society (SBC) and the Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), are key elements to support the construction of the PPC. In Computer Science courses, software engineering is presented as a central element in technological training for students. Software engineering defines stages for the construction of quality software, which begins with the requirements conception, analysis, design and ends with the construction of the solution. The scope of this article will deal with the software design area, which is responsible for defining an implementable structure for a software product, which meets the specified requirements, that is, makes the communication interface between the requirements and the construction of the software. In the specialized literature, the area of Software Design (SD) is presented as important and emerging topics in the training of Computing professionals. Emerging topics for teaching Software Engineering aligned with teaching Software Design were identified, such as: UX Design Practices, Current Interface Prototyping Tools and Design Patterns. One of the challenges for the area of Software Engineering is the high heterogeneity of solutions, leading to hybrid systems, with multi-paradigms, and this heterogeneity reflects on how the professional designs the solution, what is directly associated with training in Software Design. The justification for the development of this article is given by the need to understand how the curricula of Computer Science courses are contemplating the Software Design stage and the alignment of contents to the SWEBOK guide. Given this context, the objective of this work is to identify the panorama of Software Design teaching in the Computer Science course in Higher Education Institutions in Brazil. To this end, an analysis of the disciplines of the courses selected for the research was carried out, in order to identify which SubTopics defined in the SWEBOK for the Software Design knowledge area are present in the subjects. It was observed the diversity of subjects that deal with aspects of Software Design and the dispersion of these contents throughout the student's academic path, with the highest concentration in the 2nd and 3rd year of the course. In addition, contents related to Software Design Quality are little explored in CS courses. The study enables the discussion on teaching software design in the computer science course, seeking to address the gaps identified in this study, with the objective of making improvements in Project Pedagogical of the courses from the perspective of teaching software design.";

Normally, the process of science development should be continuous; in another words, the latter is the extension of the former. Then science development fault is proposed to describe the case against the normal situation. It means that the former ends while the latter starts on a new base. This paper describes two science development faults and then predicts that the third science development fault probably comes from the field of quantum computers and quantum communication.";

bibo:abstract "This innovative practice full paper describes a novel twofold approach to analyze the data collected during a six-week research-based summer professional development workshop for middle and high school STEM teachers in Southwest Missouri. In the fast-evolving field of Computer Science (CS), particularly within the Internet of Things (IoT) domain, the demand for a skilled workforce is increasing. To meet this demand, it is crucial to provide K-12 students with education in computing, computational thinking, and other broader Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The existing STEM curriculum could be enhanced to develop skills such as research-based problem-solving more effectively, aiming for a more comprehensive skill set among students. Therefore, empowering STEM teachers with a solid foundation of research-based problem-solving skills can significantly boost their readiness for the classroom, thus enriching their students' educational experiences. The Research Opportunity for Smart Environments (ROSE) program, a three-year initiative funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), aims to prepare middle and high school STEM teachers to effectively introduce CS concepts through innovative IoT applications in Smart Environments, including Smart Homes and Smart Classrooms. To support STEM education in rural and other underrepresented areas, a cohort of in-service teachers from rural Southwest Missouri was selected for the inaugural ROSE summer workshop. Our data collection approach included open-ended questions and effective formative assessment techniques to gather the teachers' perspectives during the initial summer session. We adopted a twofold data analysis strategy, using the qualitative coding tool MAXQDA and sentiment analysis tools Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) and TextBlob, to analyze the teachers' responses. The research questions explored the impact of the ROSE program on educators and how their experiences and outlooks influenced their engagement and professional development within the program. The findings indicate that the ROSE program has positively influenced the teachers' personal and professional growth. The teachers experienced increased confidence and knowledge in research and teaching CS concepts, despite facing various challenges, which acted as motivation for learning. Their reflections also indicated that the mentorship and resources provided by the ROSE program have promoted the development of innovative teaching methods and a shift towards a student-centered approach, showcasing the program's success in fostering the personal and professional development of teachers for the advancement of future CS and STEM professionals.";

bibo:abstract "Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement.";

bibo:abstract "Worldwide public health concerns include violence towards women as well as children. One in three women globally, according to estimates, has been the victim of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. Like adults, one in two children experiences some type of violence every year, including bullying and domestic abuse. Women and children are increasingly more susceptible to additional forms of abuse including cyberbullying or emotional harassment because of the extensive use of the Internet and social media. In recent years, computer science and associated technologies have been used to assist address this societal issue. Solutions to identify and stop violence against women and children have been developed using cloud computing, pattern recognition, mobile computing, ubiquitous artificial intelligence, as well as associated systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of some of the initiatives that might assist in addressing the issue of violence against children and women. The present state of these contributions is discussed in this study along with trends, designs, technologies, and open issues. A review of the scholarly literature from 2010 to 2020 was used to produce the survey. The contributions were categorized into four application domains: education, safety, offline detection, and online detection. Digital simulation, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence were employed as additional categories to further divide these contributions.";

The concept of a semantic wave refers to the process of moving between abstract, theoretical knowledge and concrete, practical examples to create deeper understanding and learning. Considering this, our proposed model in the field of algorithmic thinking is intended to support pre-service computer science teachers and educators in designing instructional processes that are easy to implement and facilitate swift planning and reflection for K-12 computer science education. Initial results indicate promising outcomes but also suggested areas for enhancement. This research furthermore delves into refining the model through the incorporation of notional machines and the computational action approach for improving the training of future computer science teachers and students for the challenges of digital transformation.";

NxTEL incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to guide an individual student for self-paced learning and assessment, as well as to facilitate computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) between a group of students. Furthermore, NxTEL encourages students to create curriculum content to the platform. This will not only enrich the content of the platform, but also more importantly, cultivate stronger student ownership of the knowledge. Finally, NxTEL incorporates gamification elements and social networking elements to further engage students. As a case study, we elaborate how to use the proposed NxTEL platform in a computer networks course. More specifically, first, we develop a multi-dimensional knowledge map for the Computer Network curriculum. Second, based on the knowledge map, we develop AI-driven modules for self-paced learning and assessment. Third, we develop AI-driven modules for computer-supported collaborative learning. Fourth, we develop a theoretical framework towards the conceptual understanding of motivation and self-efficacy for NxTEL-powered education in computer science.";

However, for example in the computer science, it could cover only about 180 from thousands of conferences across all subject categories, which is very limited in a practical usage. Therefore, this paper proposed a newly constructed CiteScore system lookalike, based on conference papers retrieved from Scopus. Those conference names must be processed through a deduplication step and CiteScore calculation. Based on the top 10 conferences of the CiteScore values, the correlation between the proposed system and the existing CiteScore system is approximately 0.978. While, based on the top 10% most cited conference papers of the computer science field in Scopus, the correlation is slightly dropped to 0.930, but is still very high. It also could be concluded to that the more number of conference papers could be retrieved, the higher correlation could be obtained.";

bibo:abstract "There has been a national call to diversify the STEM workforce for a number of decades. While in some areas of STEM, the participation of African Americans has increased, in the field of computer science, participation continues to be low. As of 2022, African Americans received only 2.1 % of Master's degrees and 1.7% of PhDs awarded in the field of computer science (CS) [1]. Access to quality CS experiences and opportunities is one barrier that specifically hinders the success of African American students in earning degrees, especially terminal degrees in CS. But even when they do have access, there are incongruencies between their home culture and the culture of CS. The degree of cultural difference between students' “home cultures” and the cultures of science and higher education plays a key role in their success [2]. Students who come from backgrounds that are culturally congruent with the field of CS are more likely to have “a smooth transition” into the field [3]. Many minoritized students such as African Americans, whose cultures can be conceived as being incongruent with the field of CS are more likely to have a difficult transition into the field unless they have the assistance of “cultural brokers” who can help them cross the so- called cultural border. In this paper, the authors conceive of mentors as a type of cultural broker who supports students as they traverse between their cultural norms and the norms of CS programs without having to fully assimilate [4], [5]. Our paper draws from the literature on cultural border crossings to examine the ways in which social networks and mentorship support Black and African American students “cross” from their respective home cultures into the cultural context defined by institutions of higher education, more specifically, CS graduate programs. Our primary research questions are 1) how do students navigate incongruencies between their home culture and the cultures of their schools and CS programs and 2) what roles do social networks and mentorship play in helping students navigate these incongruencies?";

bibo:abstract "Recent years have brought about the development of powerful tools for verifying specifications of hardware and software systems. By now, major companies, such as Intel, IBM, AT&T, Siemens, and BT have realized the impact and importance of such tools in their own design and implementation processes as a means of coping with the ever-increasing complexity of chip and software designs. This necessitates the availability of a basic formal training that allows undergraduate students to gain sufficient proficiency in using and reasoning with such tool-animated frameworks. We present an existing course, \"Logical Foundations of Programming\", that aims at meeting these educational goals. After describing inherent challenges that such a course faces, we then evaluate this course in the larger context of what logical frameworks, if any, should be taught and where they may be placed in a computer science related undergraduate curriculum.";

We present our records of application of such active learning activities used in theory/mathematics-oriented Computer Science courses and discuss its effectiveness by comparing the students' performance on the same topics before and after the use of such activities as well as students' written comments in the course evaluation surveys. In addition, we will discuss the effectiveness of the lecture videos recorded during class and made available on the desire2learn and moodle pages. The students' overall performance will be compared before and after the lecture video posting and students' written comments on the course evaluation survey will be quoted to confirm the helpfulness of the recorded videos in the students' improved understanding.";

bibo:abstract "Within K-12 computing education, the building blocks that contribute to student success and equitable outcomes are broadly captured in the CAPE framework (i.e., capacity, access, participation, experience). However, these broad components provide limited detail on the important factors that can support academic achievement, particularly within each component. Our research question for this study was: What are factors comprising each component of CAPE that support academic achievement among K-12 CS students ?To answer this question, we first created an a priori set of factors based on previous research findings that have been found to contribute to academic achievement. After organizing these factors within each CAPE component, we conducted a systematic mapping review of K-12 CS education research (2019–2021) (n = 196) from publicly available peer-reviewed articles from the K-12 CS Education Research Resource Center. Through this mapping, we identified an additional set of factors that have been studied by CS education researchers and added these to our set of factors. More importantly, we found that capacity was the component investigated the most frequently and access was the least. There are many areas (or categories) within each component that remain unstudied (i.e., dual credit offerings, career guidance), even though they play a role in computing education. The expanded CAPE framework is now publicly available and can be used to inform researchers and practitioners about what each CAPE component comprises. These factors are accompanied by descriptions of each factor. Not only does it highlight the many factors to be considered when designing and delivering computing education to K-12 students, it also provides a solid framework for future research that synthesizes or analyzes homogeneous factors or explores how various factors may be correlated.";

bibo:abstract "The growth in the number of places in Brazilian higher education was of great benefit to the country, bypassing the elitist model that marked the beginning of academic activities in Brazi. However, the social and economic impact can be minimized by the occurrence of the evasion phenomenon. We highlight the investments in science, technology and innovation that has higher education as its great ally, especially in what refers to technology courses. The evasion has been the motivation of several studies on education in higher education, and the results of these studies should subsidize the academic managers to initiate actions that minimize the occurrence of this phenomenon, and make that an offered upper course provides the expected economic and social impact. In this sense, this work performs an analysis of the phenomenon of evasion in a course of Computer Science of a public institution under the prism of several previous works on the subject, and with new contributions of the authors. The results bring a discussion about the use of evasion rates and use a categorization of evasion dimensions, adapted from previous approaches.";

This article aims to address the most subject areas, top productive countries, the most influential authors, the most productive and influential journals/proceedings, the most used/influential keywords, and research trends related to Industry 4.0 based on documents indexed by Scopus. The method used is scientometrics and linear regression. It is revealed that Germany, China and Italy are the most prolific countries, but US, Portugal and UK are the most impactful countries. Researchers from China also dominate the top ten of most influential authors. The study prediction shows that Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Intelligent/Smart Manufacturing, Automation, and Big Data will dominate researches in 2018 and the next two years.";

bibo:abstract "There have been different attitudes about video games in education. There are many proponents of using video games as a learning supplement. Many studies show that test scores improved using video games. Since games could make learning enjoyable, the arguments for using video games appeared to be self-evident. Other studies suggest that games are addictive and cause anti-social behavior. There is research that suggests games create apathy and introversion that is anti-social. However, the later analysis shows that video games are more beneficial than detrimental. This proposal will present evidence that using video games is helpful in learning. The perceived problems with games do not fit the pathology criteria. Thus using video games in the greater context of life balance will prevent adverse pathology. Some dedicate their lives to studying at the expense of all, which does not make scholarships detrimental. This manuscript first presents studies that show how video games improve learning. The neurological implications make video games a positive force in education and address the concerns through studies that have answered these concerns. Thirdly, examples of educators using video games as a pedagogy. Finally, further research needs to use video games as a comprehensive curriculum and its implications. The implications are to evolve video games from supplemental to integrate them into the curriculum utilizing AI and SOA.";

The population for this study consists of educational institutions across Indonesia, including primary and secondary levels. Data will be collected through accreditation documents, gathered from the National Accreditation Agency. The research findings indicate that management standards have a positive influence on evaluation, process, and content standards, underscoring the importance of effective management in promoting continuous improvement and aligning educational practices with desired outcomes. The standards for educational personnel were found to negatively impact evaluation standards, while infrastructure and facilities standards positively affected evaluation but negatively influenced process and content standards. Financing standards showed no significant influence on outcome standards. In enhancing graduate competency standards, content standards negatively impacted, while process and evaluation standards contributed positively. The study findings suggest that optimizing educational quality necessitates improving management standards, engaging teachers in professional development, ensuring efficient learning practices, and maintaining rigorous evaluation processes. When applied to engineering and computer science education, these findings can foster an environment of continuous learning and innovation, promote professional development for educators, highlight the need for well-equipped facilities, and emphasize the importance of aligning instructional practices with curricular goals, thereby preparing graduates to meet the challenges of the 21st century.";

bibo:abstract "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in educational settings, raising questions about their efficacy in standardized testing contexts. This study evaluates the performance of popular LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Llama-3.1-70B, Mistral Large 2, DeepSeek-V2, and Gemma-2-27B, in answering data structure and algorithm design questions from the Iranian university entrance exams for master’s programs in computer science and information technology. The research analyzes the accuracy of responses, the length of answers, required reading time, and vocabulary levels across the 2022,2023, and 2024 exams. Questions were categorized into five main areas: Algorithm Analysis and Complexity, Sorting and Searching, Graph Algorithms, Data Structures, and Advanced Topics and NP-completeness. The study compares the LLMs’ performance in both Persian and English contexts, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities and limitations in this domain. Results indicate that GPT-4o achieved the highest average accuracy ($\\mathbf{7 5. 0 \\%}$), followed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet (67.2%) and Mistral Large 2 (64.1%). The majority of the models performed better on English questions compared to Persian, with GPT-4o showing the largest performance gap (81.3% vs $\\mathbf{6 8. 8 \\%}$). The findings offer insights into the practical applications of LLMs in educational assessments and contribute to the ongoing discourse on the role of AI in academia, particularly in non-English speaking regions.";

bibo:abstract "Incoming students in post-secondary education often perceive Computer Science (CS) under a series of stereotypes. While it is certainly difficult to define CS, it seems still possible to grasp its scope through comprehensive points of view, addressing for example its foundations, technologies, and uses. This paper proposes a retrospective analysis of a 21-hour course trial realized in a French engineering school for six consecutive years; its aim was to help recent K12 graded students to have a more objective vision of CS. We start by discussing freshmen's CS dominant conceptions, and the role they think it plays for their future career. We then give some statistical elements concerning student perception of such a course; in particular, we analyze the obtained feedbacks and the limits of intended learning outcomes. In the light of this analysis, it is possible to state that, although initially reluctant to CS due to misconceptions, some students can develop interest and expectancy for this discipline as applied to engineering. A clarified vision of CS seems moreover to contribute to better adjusting choices of minors and majors and facilitate reasoned career plans. We finally conclude on some possible future issues in this subject for our society.";

bibo:abstract "India graduates 1.5 million engineering students every year, majority of them from its Tier 2 and Tier 3 colleges where there is severe shortage of qualified faculty and lab infrastructure, and where English is second or third language for most students. To provide affordable virtual laboratories to these engineering colleges, Government of India runs the Virtual Labs project with a select set of participating institutions to create virtual labs required for entire engineering student population of India. The program suffers from two problems: 1) lack of focus on pedagogy and learnability of labs being created, and 2) little ability to scale to more teachers and subject matter experts to produce labs aligned to local contexts. This paper presents a model (LEAD model) for the design of virtual labs for a data structures and algorithms course in computer science and is intended to address the problems stated above. The model encodes the principles of learning in the design and structure of an experiment so that labs can be learnable by design. The model is based on constructivist theory of learning. It uses Bloom's Taxonomy for defining learning objectives and applies Merrill's first principles and Gagne's 9 events of instruction as instructional design methodologies. To ensure tasks in an experiment indeed aid learning, the model requires a mapping between tasks and learning principles to be created and published along with the experiment. The model uses a pedagogy that lays strong emphasis on conceptual understanding without the use of code or program. To demonstrate the efficacy of this model, we present the data analysis of the feedback from early users of one the experiments. Even though limited in scope, data shows that experiments built using LEAD model can aid understanding for the students.";

bibo:abstract "The academic community has identified some critical issues facing the sector and are trying to Figure out how these can be addressed. One of these issues is that Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields have notoriously low retention rates. According to 2016 report on Australia's STEM workforce only 32% are university qualified. LA has become an emerging research field where knowledge is extracted and patterns are discovered from e-learning systems. LA provides a set of techniques which can help improve the retention rate by identifying students' needs, and analysing students' learning behaviour patterns. The objective of our research is to introduce a data-driven investigation to determine students' learning behaviour in a computer science course. Our research uses a variety of techniques such as Clustering (K-Means), and Classification (Decision Tree Induction) in order to achieve the goal to discover data-driven knowledge from the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) and the Student Information System (SIS). The analysis was carried out using log data obtained from Moodle and student's information obtained from the SIS in a computer science course. The study collected demographic profiles of students studying a course in Information Systems and Analysis and compared them to find answers to questions such as how student's engagement to online activities and accessing learning resources impact students' success rate and hence improving retention rate by identifying students need on time. For this work, Rapid Miner data mining tool was used to mine and analyse data from the SIS and the Moodle system.";

bibo:abstract "In order to generate interest in computer science and its various fields, we designed a Computer Science (CS) Day, an enriched computing program, for middle school students in October of 2022. A group of 53 middle school students was invited to our campus to learn about computer science and tour the campus. These students attended a local public school and were involved in a robotics club at their school. This paper describes our workshops at CS Day, which aimed to provide students with a better understanding of computer science and its related fields. The CS Day provided students with the opportunity to learn about computer science as a career and computer science concepts. Several lectures and activities were created to provide a fulfilling and interactive day of learning for the students. Touring our campus and interacting with college students exposed middle school students to the idea of pursuing a college degree in computer science. The students learned about careers in computer science, basic computer programming concepts, the concept of binary and how it relates to computer hardware, artificial intelligence, game design and development, and the concept of blockchain. We presented learning activities that were interactive and hands-on, allowing the students to learn by doing. By the end of the CS Day, each student had gained valuable insights into the world of computer science and its applications, which can help them make more informed decisions about future career plans. We provided pre-and post-tests for two of our workshops to assess if our workshops helped students increase their understanding of computer science concepts. The pre-and post-surveys asked questions about translating binary and performing basic math with it. Additionally, the survey asked basic questions about computers and their binary relation. During the lecture, the students were given papers to help them follow and learn from the lecture, and a binary game to test their knowledge after the lecture. Our studies show that the student scores improved by 100% or more in both workshops between the pre-and postworkshop assessments. The assessment questions were the same in the pre-and post-tests to ensure consistency. Our assessment results show that our CS Day was very successful, and it is hoped that enriched computing programs like this will encourage more young students to pursue careers in computer science and help address the growing demand for skilled professionals in the computing industry. We present this paper to share the interactive learning activities we designed, the results of pre-and post-tests we conducted with the students, and future work in the area of outreach to secondary school-aged students in the field of computer science.";

bibo:abstract "This innovative practice full paper describes an experience of using MILAGE LEARN+ with Computer Science university students. Students motivation when in an academic setting is a very important aspect of how well they will learn the material provided. Many computer science students own smart phones, tablets, and computers in order to complete their work and study. Here we introduce MILAGE LEARN+ to fourth year computer science university students. MILAGE LEARN+ is a mobile educational application where students take quizzes, watch videos, and do assignments in worksheet format. This application integrates the gamification pedagogy with the usage of difficulty levels, a leader board, as well as self and peer-review in order to benefit students' motivation, autonomy, and their grades. While MILAGE LEARN+ has been used in many European countries with a variety of age groups and fields of study there has been no research done on how American students connect with the application. In this study we are examining how university students in computer science react to the usage of this application. MILAGE LEARN+ was integrated into a 400-level computer science course at a Research 1, land-grant university, for the usage of quiz taking. We have focused on usage of the leader board, peer-review, and self-review to answer the following questions: How does MILAGE LEARN+ affect students' motivation? Does it benefit their grades? And is it an overall positive experience for our students? Participation in this study was entirely voluntary and those who chose not to participate were given an alternative assignment using Canvas quizzes. The study was reviewed and approved by the IRB committee of our University. There were 38 students participating in this study. All of these students are majoring in computer science or engineering equivalent course. Students had four weeks to take a series of ten quizzes. These quizzes covered content covered in class and were worth ten points on each quiz. Most of the quizzes had five questions worth two points each with a select few having ten questions worth one point each. The quizzes contained a variety of answering styles including: multiple choice, true/false, and free response through the keyboard. We compared these quizzes to an exam on Canvas LMS. The Canvas exam had all of the same questions as provided in the MILAGE LEARN+ quizzes. These response styles were also a mix of multiple choice, true/false, and free response through the keyboard. Student users later evaluated the application and quizzes through electronic survey. The survey included 15 questions, 12 of which were answers based on the Likert-type scale. MILAGE LEARN+ was shown to have a higher percentage of students get a question correct on the quizzes in comparison to those using the Canvas learning management system. Though, MILAGE LEARN+ students were also shown to have issues with the application. While there were some limitations with our study, our results were statistically significant and shown that MILAGE LEARN+ does in fact boost students' grades, even if they encounter difficulties with using the application.";

Detailed analyses and findings of a proposed course assessment framework that primarily uses direct assessment techniques are presented. Two online courses are compared, an introductory programming class versus a computer literacy one. The paper employs two different data sets. The first set are collected then analyzed to compare the levels of achievement of Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) across the studied groups. ILO achievement levels are represented as EAMU vectors then used collectively in the comparison. Statistical analyses of these vectors using both Chi-square and t-tests have shown that there are no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The second data set is used to directly measure and compare a number of factors representing students' success. The obtained results for the majority of success measures denoted that there are no statistically significant differences between the two groups except for withdrawal rate and resource utilization levels which were higher in the introductory programming group. Discussions of the obtained results are provided along with how such findings can support the effectiveness of online delivery.";

bibo:abstract "This is a full research paper. Including underrepresented minority groups (URM) in the computing field has been a challenge in the United States for a long time. Specifically, African American, Hispanic/Latinx and native American students continue to have low participation in computer science majors despite efforts to include these groups in Computer Science majors in the United States. In this context, the paper presents the research question: What types of publications are there in the literature about activities focused on including underrepresented minority groups in Computer Science majors in the United States? URM in this paper means minority African-American, Hispanic/Latinx and Native American students. To answer this question, a systematic literature mapping process covering the last 15 years (2009–2023) was applied using four academic sources: Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. The inclusion criteria were: documents published in a conference or journal; documents published in the period 2009-2023; computer science and education areas; documents focusing on underrepresented minority groups, specifically African American and Latinx/Hispanic and Native American; and documents concerning the undergraduate level. The exclusion criteria were: documents with less than four pages (an attempt to map only full papers); documents in a language other than English; documents that do not mention African American and Latinx/Hispanic; and documents from educational institutions outside of the U.S. We found 521 relevant papers about URM and CS majors, most of which were published at ASEE, FIE, and SIGCSE conferences. There has been an increasing number of papers published in these 15 years. In the last five years, 329 papers were found, representing more than 63% of all papers found in this literature mapping. The universities with the most publications were Florida University, the University of Texas at El Paso, and Purdue University. California, Texas, and Florida are the top three states which the highest number of papers. We classified the paper and found 48 papers for EDM (educational data mining), 163 papers for Educational Model, Report 37, Perception 105, and Program 198.";

bibo:abstract "Background: Efficient data processing is an increasing additional important part in computer science, especially with large growing datasets. MATLAB is a complex and most often used tool which is well known for its computational capabilities as it comes with richer library packages than those offered by other simple programming tools, coupled with a fairly robust graphical user interface (GUI). This study exploring the capabilities of MATLAB built-in tools, GUIDE and App Designer, which allow integrating advanced data processing models with user-friendly interfaces.Objective The study aims to assess the capability of MATLAB in mining complex data as well as providing an intuitive interface for users with different levels of programming skills, The aim is to show how MATLAB’s GUI capabilities can be used to significantly simplify real-time data visualization and manipulate of various advanced computation techniques such as neural networks, regression models or multivariate calibration.Methodology: The study researchers created GUIs using MATLAB's GUIDE and App Designer that were hooked up to sophisticated models of computation for data processing. These included neural networks, predictive analytics and real-time data stream processing. The evaluation was done by using these tools on datasets in domains (image processing, and real-time sensor monitoring), based on the performance measurements like throughput speed, accuracy, and user-friendliness.Results: Combining computational modeling of MATLAB with GUI design for complex data tasks extended the accessibility and maneuverability in handling results. Even non-programmable users could effectively communicate with the system, and typical operations performed well model wise, data processing was a real-time thing. The researchers also noted additional avenues for improvement, such as dealing with big-data and integrating upcoming technologies including quantum computing.Conclusion: This feature of MATLAB makes it very user-friendly because computational prowess is combined with GUI development, making it useful for heavy-duty data processing tasks pubs are involved in. The results indicate MATLAB to be a universal tool, allowing for both expert and non-expert users to conduct complex computational problems in a wide range of scientific and industrial domains. It should be improved for more functionality, such as with larger datasets and new technological applications.";

bibo:abstract "In an effort to broaden participation in computer science education, a school district built a K-12 pathway with an immersive computer science experience at the middle school level. Approximately sixty students at both the 6th and 7th grade levels participate in a computer science elective as well as core content areas of health, art, social studies, and language Arts with computing integrated within. This experience paper will overview the design and development of a program with the goal of developing computing identities in Black, Hispanic, and Asian students through immersive computer science experiences. Using observations of lessons and planning meetings, interviews with students and staff, and analysis of course documentation we will describe the evolving program thus far. Specifically we will detail the tensions and solutions of prioritizing the experience of underrepresented populations of students through recruitment, pedagogy, student feedback, professional development, and navigating school systemic exclusionary mechanisms.";

bibo:abstract "This work presents a large scale literature review on the question of what a laboratory in computer science is. This question arises since computer science has different traditions and is thus harder to grasp compared to more traditional fields of study. A total of 83 papers from the IEEE and ACM digital libraries were inductively categorised. All reviewed papers were published between the years 2017 and 2021. The results show that most laboratories are described in the context of teaching (course development and broader education / laboratory pedagogy research). One big problem in current laboratories seems to be that most are described without any didactical concepts, and the didactical concepts described by the included papers cover a wide range of principles. The disciplines of the reviewed laboratories are highly diverse and span across a wide spectrum with most papers either focussing on programming / software development or do not have a specific laboratory description.";

bibo:abstract "This paper reviews published research in the field of computer-aided colorization technology. We argue that within this context, the colorization task can be considered to originate from computer graphics, advance by introducing computer vision, and progress towards the fusion of vision and graphics. Hence, we propose a specific taxonomy and organize the research work chronologically. We extend the existing reconstruction-based colorization evaluation techniques on the basis that aesthetic assessment should be introduced to ensure the computer- colored images closely satisfy human visual-related requirements. We then perform an aesthetic assessment using the proposed metric and existing evaluations, comparing the colorization performance of seven representative unconditional colorization models. Finally, we identify unresolved issues and propose fruitful areas for future research and development. Details of the project associated with this survey can be obtained at https://github.com/DanielCho-HK/Colorization.";

This innovative study programme design has emerged in Sweden due to an alarming demand for more Upper Secondary School teachers in STEM subjects. Studies on alumni from these programmes indicate that the graduates are highly appreciated not only as teachers in schools, but also in business and industry, e.g. in roles as IT consultants and computer science engineers. Data indicate that the breadth of the combined education, and especially leadership and pedagogical skills, are important factors for these graduates' success as engineers.";

bibo:abstract "The limited inference capabilities of large language models in the field of computer science significantly hinder their application in computer education question-answering tasks. To address this issue, this paper focuses on three key areas: constructing domain-specific datasets, enhancing these datasets, and fine-tuning large language models to improve their performance in computer education question answering. The foundational dataset is sourced from university and online question banks, consisting of over 1600 entries, including 678 multiple-choice questions, 502 true/false questions, and 509 fill-in-the-blank questions. These questions span 11 disciplines, such as artificial intelligence, software engineering, and digital logic. Additionally, this study uses a large model for data augmentation, expanding the scope and scale of the base dataset. The augmented content is sourced from Baidu Baike and GPT-generated text, ultimately increasing the dataset to over 10000 entries. Based on this expanded dataset, the study employs LoRA technology to fine-tune the LLaMA2-7B model. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the fine-tuned model significantly outperforms other baselines across various task types.";

The philosophy has given rise to a new metric-the extent and significance of the knowledge \"discovered\" by the students, towards evaluating the quality of such courses. Discovery refers to the knowledge that is brought out into the open by the student for himself/herself, and it is significant in that it becomes an integral part of the individual who not only gains invaluable insight and confidence in the subject matter but can improvise, reason, and apply it to other areas in creative ways. The article illustrates the application of the metric through a number of actual cases encountered during teaching at ASU.";

bibo:abstract "A mock examination is an exam that does not count for credit. It is taken before an official examination and gives students the opportunity to practice for the later, important exam. The mock examination provides students with information on their actual learning progress and gives them in this way the opportunity to fill knowledge gaps. An electronic mock examination is the online variant usually taken unsupervised in the students' own time. In this work we present the setup of an electronic mock exam in the course \"Basics of Computer Science\". We discuss question types other than multiple-choice that allow for fully automated marking. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of the results of the mock exam. These results demonstrate that students consider the electronic mock exam as valuable help for exam preparation. Half of the students take the mock exam even more than once and use different strategies to make the most out of it. On the other hand, lecturers get invaluable feedback from the results of the mock exam. This feedback covers all learning objectives of the entire course, comes at the right time, and is ideally suited for planning the contents of a recapitulation lecture.";

In this study, we will explore adult vocational education students of computer science that experienced the online education during the school academic year 2020–2021. The study attempts to explore the views of 10 adult students. At the same time, an attempt is made to determine the role of educational neuroscience in students' learning. Participants were asked to answer 14 questions about the online education they had experienced. This was followed by data analysis using NVivo software. According to the findings, 6 students identified the reasons why they prefer to be educated in a physical learning environment and 1 student stated that he prefers a mixed model that will include lessons with both physical and online presence. In addition, 9 out of 10 students stated that they prefer synchronous online teaching to asynchronous. Also, 7 out of 10 students identified that in the theoretical part they were able to achieve the expected learning outcomes but on the other hand, 6 out of 10 learners reported difficulties in attending the workshops. Nevertheless, 8 out of 10 stated that they were quite consistent with the obligations they had during the course. The findings indicate that the principles of educational neuroscience can be a critical component of effective online learning.";

bibo:abstract "When thinking about systems, it's tempting to only envision computational elements such as machines, operating systems, and programming languages, or human elements such as user interfaces, business practices, and public policy. However, to mangle an analogy from physics, the observer is also part of the system. When reasoning about or designing (or breaking into) secure systems, it's important to remember the tools, mindset, and background we bring to the table. Computer security's primary background fields are computer science and computer engineering (although some might make a case for mathematical logic). These fields sometimes bring very different approaches to the same basic security problems. We take a light-hearted look at these differences.";

bibo:abstract "To realize the compelling future of computing studies, researchers and analysts must rethink the traditional way of partitioning and structuring computer science and engineering. A framework that USC is already partially implementing combines an explicitly interdisciplinary academic focus with a systems-oriented perspective. A more efficient organization for computer science and engineering (CSE) - and one that helps point the way toward its promising future - requires an intrinsically interdisciplinary framework that combines academic and systems-oriented computing perspectives. A virtual organization must be able to access information through interfaces that facilitate rather than interfere with getting the job done in time-critical situations.";

bibo:abstract "Deep Learning is redefining computing. Deep Neural Networks, or DNNs, have led to breakthrough accuracy improvements for tasks formerly considered AI, like speech recognition, image classification, and translation. Recurrent DNNs are differentiable universal computers. DNNs are layered structures of relatively simple functions with millions to billions of learnable model parameters. The challenge is that these model parameters are obtained by machine learning of sometimes billions of data samples, which often requires harnessing a farm of powerful multi-GPU servers. Microsoft's open source Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is used to create the DNNs that power many Microsoft services and products. It enables researchers and data scientists to easily code such neural networks at the right abstraction level, and to efficiently train and test them on production-scale data. This talk will discuss the Cognitive Toolkit and how it takes a functional-style, differentiable user program, compiles it into a computation graph for GPU execution, and distributes execution of its training across a GPU-server farm. This talk will explain how the toolkit's design intersects with several topics of interest to the three co-located conferences.";

bibo:abstract "Cybersecurity is a multiagent system where intelligent agents interact, formulate strategies, fight, cooperate, coordinate, design systems, and plan actions to achieve their goals of cybersecurity or hacking and malicious damages. Game theory analyses and formulates strategies and designs rules or mechanisms for this cybersecurity multiagent system on the basis of artificial intelligence. For specifying, characterising and modelling and designing this intelligent multiagent system, mathematical game theory models of different forms can be developed, such as static, dynamic, evolutionary, differential and stochastic game theory models. Different algorithms such as Nash equilibrium, joint optimisation, evolutionary algorithms, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and other machine learning algorithms can be applied to different game theory models for analysing, solving, and computing these cybersecurity models. Findings from these models are used to formulate strategies, cooperate, coordinate, design systems, and plan actions by different intelligent agents and authorities in cybersecurity. Game theory application in cybersecurity is an important area in computer science for doing highly useful academic and practical cybersecurity activities and for academics and practitioners to build their careers. Therefore, it is necessary to prioritise this area of game theory and cybersecurity in computer science for research and development.";

This workshop aims to arm educators and industry leaders with targeted strategies to nurture a sense of belonging for Black women in this critical domain. The session will be divided into two primary focus areas: 1) Effective resources that can be integrated into educational frameworks to support academic and professional development, and 2) Industry interventions that can alter the existing narrative within the Black community about STEM education and careers. Built on empirically validated practices and strategies, the workshop's goal is to equip participants with actionable measures that can be implemented within their organizations and communities. Attendees will leave with a comprehensive toolkit designed to foster educational and industrial collaboration that addresses the specific challenges faced by Black women in technology.";

During two days of presentations and seminars in late April, the sentiment was echoed by the secretary of energy, the White House science advisor, two congressmen, and the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Sometimes we need to convince people that science is worth funding, they said.";

Here, the author suggests that one of the relevant professional societies—such as IEEE—take leadership in addressing this issue by creating a committee that would track and publicize such behaviors to create backpressure against them and reverse these negative trends. Moreover, an existing mechanism within IEEE that handles plagiarism complaints could provide the foundation for the broader misconduct committee proposed here.";

bibo:abstract "The changing job market requires an educational system that can adapt to the evolving skills that are required, ensuring that the teaching methods are aligned with the preferences of young learners. The aim of this paper is to investigate various learning perspectives from students, teachers, and adult learners, as well as to examine industry challenges and opportunities. It emphasizes the need for a flexible and dynamic educational approach to prepare students for current and future labor markets and technological advancements. This paper is also an editorial paper, summarizing submitted papers to the workshop. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was used to search and select the latest research in the field of computer science education, focusing on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve learning. Six research questions were addressed, considering not only the three perspectives (student, teacher, and practitioner), but also topics such as skills and tools. Key topics highlight the importance of integrating soft skills and ethics in computer science education, increasing the use of AI in teaching/learning, developing new online/collaborative technology-enabled teaching models, and increasing interest in teacher and practitioner continuous training. In the learning process, both the teacher and the student have reciprocal influence, and the teacher plays the role of facilitator, allowing students to learn at their own pace. In industry settings, the need to develop soft skills in recent computer science graduates and align these skills with the rapidly evolving requirements of the labor market was acknowledged.";

Sadly, what he might-have told us of what he thought when he did it is now lost forever. We will never have his firsthand account to help us learn how to do great things ourselves. I hope potential authors of reminiscences, memoirs, and autobiographies will act now to avoid further losses.";

bibo:abstract "Study of collaboration in research and publication is useful for understanding the sociological aspects of R&D and can also be an aid in policy formulation and R&D management. Despite some limitations, nonreactive bibliometric methods are more effective than the survey method for estimating the degree of collaboration in R&D. The mean number of authors per paper and the ratio of multiple-author papers to the total number of papers published in a discipline can be used as unobtrusive indicators of the degree of collaboration in research and publication. Within computer science, there seems to be a higher degree of collaborative R&D in hardware and applications areas than in the software area. The mean number of authors per paper across all the subfields of computer science is about 1.7. The average size of collaborative R&D teams is about 2.7 persons. Computer science as a discipline is closer to mathematics than to biochemistry or chemical engineering, both of which are highly collaborative fields.";

Pistilli Scholarship program is to increase the pool of professionals in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science from under represented groups (women, African American, Hispanic, Native American, and physically challenged). In 1989, ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (SIGDA) began providing the program. Beginning in 1993, the Design Automation Conference provided the funds for the scholarship, and SIGDA continues to administer the program for DAC. DAC normally funds two or more $4000 scholarships, renewable up to 5 years, to graduatiiig high school seniors. The 2005 winners are: Elizabeth Hong-An Boi Ha - attending Georgia Institute of Technology and Hans Edgar Anderson - attending Massachusetts Institute of Technology.";

bibo:abstract "We probably all have an outdated mental image of the legal profession. Perhaps we think of ceiling-high bookcases overflowing with caramel-coloured, leather-bound tomes on case law. Possibly, subterranean archives with row upon row of rarely consulted metal filing cabinets. Even roll-top escritoires buried under sheaves of manuscript documents bundled together with lawyers' red ribbon, and yellow notepads annotated in fountain pen. But these clichés are more the stylisations of television drama because, as Katie Atkinson explains, the legal profession is moving on and is starting to use artificial intelligence to do the grunt work.";

dblp:title "The computer and the mind - An introduction to cognitive science [Book Review]";
dblp:publishedBy "IEEE";
bibo:abstract "Johnson-Laird haswrittena book that isasaccessibletotheintelligent high school student as it is to the engineer or computer scientist. Unfortunately, however, this book is not nearly as satisfying as a popular work on physics or mathematics, since cognitive sciencefalls far short of those other sciences in its ability to describe, explain, and predict interesting phenomena. Again and again the author describes fascinating experimental or empirical results, constructs computational models producing similar behavior, and then reaches a dead end. There is simply too little understanding of the mechanisms of brain and mind to assert a connection between the computational models and anything real. The result has too much of the flavor of works on artificial intelligence. What saves Johnson-Laird's book and makes it interesting to the general reader are the philosophical issues that he confronts head on. Johnson-Laird also cites and answers criticisms that he characterizes as metaphysical and those that he characterizes as scientific. Predictably, he concludes in the end that cognitive science is on the right track and that it is leading to thedevelopment of intelligent softwareand a humane technology. He hopes that it will yield advances in psychoanalytic theory and practice as well. The book contains many verbal descriptions of algorithms and models. This material is hard to read straight through, making the book drag a little. The material is fascinating and the author is knowledgeable, but the reader's expectation of increased understanding is constantly frustrated.";

bibo:abstract "This paper reports on how the US Defense Department has been slowly reducing its annual budget for computer science research in favor of near-term projects with a strictly military focus. While researchers can seek funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), their grants tend to be smaller than compared to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which appears to favor industry laboratories over the academia. Despite denials from DARPA officials, those familiar with budgetary decision making within the Pentagon say that there in fact has been a shift at DARPA, driven in large part by the country's ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are also those who believe that the IT industry, rather than the federal government, should sponsor its own research.";

bibo:abstract "With the advent of distributed computing, the need for frameworks that facilitate its programming and management has also appeared. These tools have typically been used to support the research on application areas that require them. This poses good initial conditions for translational computer science (TCS), although this does not always occur. This article describes our experience with the PyCOMPSs project, a programming model for distributed computing. While it is a research instrument for our team, it has also been applied in multiple real use cases under the umbrella of European Funded projects, or as part of internal projects between various departments at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. This article illustrates how the authors have engaged in TCS as an underlying research methodology, collecting experiences from three European projects.";

Sampling technique is used for choosing sample in the population. Sampling techniques has two types': probability and non-probability. In research the sampling techniques play an important role, for decision making and analysis of data in different fields. In this paper, we have presented a review of sampling techniques from different perspectives, to enable researchers to select a best sampling technique while doing research. After study the review they will come to know which sampling technique is best suited according to the resources (time, money and effort etc.) available in the domain.";

The new guidelines for computer science are scheduled for release in 2013. This interactive session will give the computing education community an opportunity to review current working documents created by the CS2013 Steering Committee and thus influence a draft of the CS 2013 volume scheduled for release in December 2011. In early 2011, the Steering Committee began an extensive review of the Body of Knowledge and Characteristics of Graduates sections that are key parts of this series of curriculum volumes. New Knowledge Areas are being defined (Parallel and Distributed Computing, Security and Information Assurance, and Systems Fundamentals) and existing areas are being reorganized and updated. The Steering Committee will present a draft of the new Body of Knowledge as part of this session and will engage attendees in guided discussions of sections for which community input is particularly relevant. Similarly, a draft of the new Characteristics of Graduates description will be presented and discussed as part of the session.";

Engineering and Computer Science education faces significant challenges, such as rapidly evolving technologies, globalization, changing student demographics, and problems associated with funding higher education. Moreover, the rapidly emerging global economy is profoundly affecting the employment patterns and the professional life of graduates. Articles in recent issues of the ASEE Prism, education literature and recent reports form the National Academy of Engineering suggest that current educational practices and policies are not sufficient for dealing with these changes. Successfully addressing these issues will require innovative solutions, including use of new pedagogies and technologies that improve student learning; partnerships among universities, industry, government, and K-12 educators; curriculum reform; and distance learning. The panel members will describe the key challenges facing the education community and the skills our graduates need to remain competitive.";

bibo:abstract "Engineers, computer scientists, and networking engineers require robust techniques and methods to analyze algorithms, computer systems, protocol behavior, routing algorithms, and congestion in networks. A perfect source of the related information is provided with this second edition of a classic book. As we have not commented on this book before in our magazine, we fill this gap now, taking the opportunity of the situation that Wiley decided to publish the paperback version. The book provides a comprehensive introduction to probability, stochastic processes and statistics, and illustrates how these concepts can be applied in analysis, modeling, and evaluation of the reliability and performance of computer and communication systems. This is a very useful book for students, as well as reliability and computer science engineering professionals. It is focused on the performance, dependability and performability analysis of computer systems. The main strength of this book is the vast number of examples and exercises, which serve to illustrate the complex theoretical concepts and help the reader to a better understanding of the important topics. I highly recommend this book for academic use as a textbook and for researchers and professionals as a useful reference.";
